# Paragraph 4

(To discuss after the previous 3 are written)

Ideas for now:

- Biodiversity = richness AND…
  - Composition,
  - Functional diversity,
  - Phylogenetic diversity (Re: Felix’ map in the fynbos book)
- Conservation
  - Habitat diversity = more species (Re: European reserve study Tony mentioned)

Following from the understanding that functionally diverse assemblages, which are more likely to be more species rich, are likely to arise and/or occur in areas with diverse ecological pressures (Molina-Venegas et al., 2015), one would expect, then, heterogeneous habitats such as those in Mediterranean-type biodiversity hotspots to exhibit high levels functional beta diversity along steep environmental gradients (Molina-Venegas et al., 2015). If the niches concerning these functions are phylogenetically conserved among those biota, then one would also expect high levels of species and phylogenetic beta diversity along these gradients (Molina-Venegas et al., 2015). This concurs with the notion put forward by Power et al. (2017), wherein megadiverse systems such as these represent the results of “phylogenetic niche conservatism on a heterogeneous landscape”. Thus, species and phylogenetic turnover should covary with environmental heterogeneity in some way. Indeed, endemism, at certain scales, could also follow this pattern. Thuiller et al. (2006) demonstrated that there are phylogenetic and biome-related determinants of species richness. This makes sense in light of the low probability of lineages crossing biome boundaries in Mediterranean systems (Power et al., 2017). NDVI and light availability, and the heterogeneity therein, are associated with high levels of floristic turnover (Power et al., 2017). This may be indicative of ecological specialisation precluding species from crossing these boundaries, thus increasing the level of endemism within a region, while also increasing the level of turnover, and thus likely species richness, along environmental gradients. Although, this may be debated. Beard et al. (2000) state that the high levels of endemism in SWA are function of habitat specialisation to soil mosaics. Cf. Laliberte et al. (2014), who say that this endemism is likely due to environmental filtering along these soil turnover sequences, as opposed to the juxtaposition of specialised species along soil gradients.
Ed: Is it worth expanding this discussion to functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity metrics too?

Summarily, we have demonstrated support for the generality of EH as a meaningful predictor of patterns of species richness and turnover in mediterranean-type ecosystems. In SWA and the Cape, high levels of are also likely the results of long-term landscape and climatic stability (Hopper, 1979). Thus, the roles of environmental variability through space that persists through deep time are two important ways in which the environment relates to biodiversity in these regions. The efficacy of environmental stability through geological time should be explored further, comparing the Cape and SWA.
