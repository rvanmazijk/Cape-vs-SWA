# Possible weaknesses to our study

(not a paragraph in discussion per se)

1. What about absolute environment variables?
  - Deal w/ post-review
  - And emphasise throughout that that is not what we are here to do
2. Species-occurrence data & collection effort?
  - Address outliers, and compare to Gioia & Hopper 2007 (Re: rarefaction etc.) to show that, indeed, our data are flawed.
  - Also note Cramer & Verboom 2017 managed in-spite of it (Re: rarefaction etc.)!
  - In addition to the scale of our data, spatial bias in species occurence data must also be considered. GBIF data are sourced from both herbaria and plot-monitoring datasets. The relative contribution of each of these to GBIF data may vary between countries and regions—i.e. between the Cape and SWA. As recently noted by Guerin (2018), herbarium records and plot-based inventories describe regional flora with varying accuracy, especially with respect to documenting high levels of floristic turnover. We emphasise here our concerns that there the floral occurence data and soils information use in this study are especially at risk of spatial bias and/or inaccuracies.
  - Another issue related to spatial scales, as with any ecological study, is that of spatially uniform and representative plant species occurence data. Efforts were made herein to minimise differences in data-quality between SWA and Cape by using remote-sensing derived environmental data. Species occurence data, however, prove difficult to obtain with uniform methodology. South African biodiversity data is stored only to QDS-level accuracy. As such, our analyses were limited to that as the finest spatial scale, such that our environmental datasets necessarily, then, were also limited to the QDS-scale. This may complicate the interpretation of our analyses, as these data may be too coarse in scale to capture patterns of species richness and turnover and their associations with the environmenta in reality in empirically heterogeneous environments like the Cape and SWA.
3. Spatial autocorrelation?
  - Our study is necessarily correlative
  - Spatial arranged response AND predictors “cancel each other out”
4. An aspect of the environment I have neglected to consider is fire, shown to also contribute to predictions here in the Cape (Cramer & Verboom, 2016). Cardillo (2012) have shown the structuring forces behind species co-occurrence patterns, and thus likely species richness, differ between species-pairs with different post-fire responses and those with similar post-fire responses.
