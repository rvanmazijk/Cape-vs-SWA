Despite undoubted spatial structure in our data, we did not incorporate spatial autocorrelation into our models of species richness. This is because the aim of our analyses was to describe associations between different forms of environmental heterogeneity and species richness. In doing so, we wish to reveal which axes of heterogeneity are similarly associated with richness in both the GCFR and SWAFR. This contrasts with, for example, efforts to predict species richness in absolute, or to partition sources of its variation. The species richness of a given area can be attributed to (i) that area's mean environmental conditions, (ii) the variety of environmental conditions within that area (i.e. the environmental heterogeneity), (iii) the broader, non-environmental, underlying spatial pattern of species richness and (iv) the richness of the regional species pool. Accounting for spatial structure allows for better estimation of the sizes of (i), (ii) and (iii) (due to the obvious inclusion of (iii)) (Legendre 1993). Of these sources of variation in species richness, our goal is not to explore the size of (ii) relative to the others, but rather described what forms of heterogeneity constitute (ii). As such, we believe accounting for spatial autocorrelation in our dataset to not only be unnecessary, but would result in the estimation of non-significant effects of some forms of heterogeneity on species richness. This would prevent us from describing all potential similarities (or differences) between the GCFR and SWAFR in terms of the forms of heterogeneity potentially importantly associated with species richness.
