Despite undoubted spatial structure in our data, we did not incorporate spatial autocorrelation into our models of species richness. This is because the aim of our analyses was to describe associations between different forms of environmental heterogeneity and species richness. In doing so, we wish to reveal which axes of heterogeneity are similarly associated with richness in both the GCFR and SWAFR. This contrasts with, for example, efforts to predict species richness in absolute, or to partition sources of its variation. In those cases, the species richness of a given area is often attributed to mean environmental conditions, the variety of environmental conditions within that area (i.e. the environmental heterogeneity) and the non-environmental, spatial pattern of species richness. Thus, accounting for spatial structure in species richness allows for better estimation of the sizes of the other partitions (Legendre 1993). Our goal, however, is not to explore the amount of variation in richness that heterogeneity explaines, but rather describe what forms of heterogeneity constitute that partition. As such, we believe accounting for spatial autocorrelation in our dataset to not only be unnecessary, but would result in the estimation of non-significant effects of some forms of heterogeneity on species richness. This would prevent us from describing all potential similarities (or differences) between the GCFR and SWAFR in terms of the forms of heterogeneity potentially importantly associated with species richness.
