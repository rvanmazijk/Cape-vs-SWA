We did not incorporate spatial autocorrelation into our models of species richness because the aim of our analyses was to expose the associations between different forms of spatial environmental heterogeneity and species richness, and do so in the two spatially discrete regions (GCFR and SWAFR). The fact that we focussed on heterogeneity between neighbouring pixels is at odds with spatial autocorrelation which occurs when neighbouring pixels are more related to each other than more distant pixels due to their proximity.
