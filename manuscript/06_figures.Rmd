## Figure 1 {-}

(ref:roughness) Comparisons of distributions of calculated environmental roughness values in the Cape and SWA, for elevation, NDVI and climatic variables (**A,B**) and edaphic variables (**C,D**).
Each row of panels within **A,C** and **B,D** illustrate the distributions for a different variable.
Violin-plots (**A,C**) of the distributions of roughness values (Z-scaled to be comparable across panels) are presented at 0.05ยบ and 3QDS scales.
Roughness values were calculated following Equation \@ref(eq:roughness).
Areas beneath curves sum to one for each violin, and points within represent the median of each distribution.
Violin-plots were constructed with Gaussian distributions with bandwidth following Silverman's "rule of thumb" [@Silverman1986].
The degree to which Cape roughness values exceed SWA values is described by the $CLES$ (see Materials and methods).
Roughness values were found to be significantly greater in the Cape in all cases ($P < 0.05$), unless marked as non-significant (NS), following Mann-Whitney $U$ tests.
The magnitude of the ranges of Z-scaled roughness values (**B,D**) vary with spatial resolution, described here by the 95%-to-5% and 99%-to-1% interquantile ranges.
Lines connect points for illustration, and are paler for the wider quantile.
<!--TODO: change IQuR in y-axes simply to "Range"-->
<!--TODO: plot jittered points on 3QDS violins, as I have seen when fiddling with PCAs that there are indeed very few points for those distributions (which is fine, but note it!)-->

## Figure 2 {-}

(ref:richness-vs-turnover) Regressions involving plant species richness and turnover.
Species turnover (as Jaccards distance) between QDS-pairs increases as pairs are more geographically separated (**A**).
Species turnover was calculated for all possible pairs of cells, but only the turnover values for a random 5000 pairs in each region have been plotted, for clarity.
Fitted lines represent the 5%-quantile regressions of turnover as a function of log-distance for each region separately.
Following a 5%-quantile regression of turnover as a function of log-distance with region as a categorical variable (Table \@ref(tab:turnover-vs-geodist-model-table)), a significant interaction between distance and region was found ($P < 0.001$), such that the Cape positively effects the distance slope term.
Scatter-plots of HDS-scale species richness against the average QDS-scale richness in a given HDS (**B**) and the average species turnover between QDS in a given HDS (**C**).
Curves represent simples linear regressions of HDS richness against these two respective independent variables (note, mean QDS richness was $log(x + 1)$-transformed), separately for each region, for illustration of the two regions' differences.
