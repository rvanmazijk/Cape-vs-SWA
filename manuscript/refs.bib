abstract = {Our understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) applies mainly to fine spatial scales. New research is required if we are to extend this knowledge to broader spatial scales that are relevant for conservation decisions. Here, we use simulations to examine conditions that generate scale dependence of the BEF relationship. We study scale by assessing how the BEF relationship (slope and R 2) changes when habitat patches are spatially aggregated. We find three ways for the BEF relationship to be scale-dependent: (i) variation among local patches in local ($\alpha$) diversity, (ii) spatial variation in the local BEF relationship and (iii) incomplete compositional turnover in species composition among patches. The first two cause the slope of the BEF relationship to increase moderately with spatial scale, reflecting nonlinear averaging of spatial variation in diversity or the BEF relationship. The third mechanism results in much stronger scale dependence, with the BEF relationship increasing in the rising portion of the species area relationship, but then decreasing as it saturates. An analysis of data from the Cedar Creek grassland BEF experiment revealed a positive but saturating slope of the relationship with scale. Overall, our findings suggest that the BEF relationship is likely to be scale dependent.},

@article{Fournier2017,
abstract = {Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are often used to predict the potential range of invasive species. Unfortunately, most studies do not evaluate variables relevance before selecting them to fit their models. Moreover, multiple variables such as climate and land use may drive species distribution at different spatial scales but most studies either use a single type of drivers, or combine multiple types without respecting their operating scale. We propose a three steps framework to overcome this limitation. First, use SDMs to select the most relevant climatic variables to predict a given species distribution, at continental scale. Then, characterize the species-habitat relationships, at a local scale, to produce species and area specific habitat filters. Finally, combine both information, each obtained at a relevant scale, to refine climatic predictions according to habitat suitability. We illustrate this framework with 14,794 Asian hornet (Vespa velutina nigrithorax) records. We show that integrating multiple drivers, while still respecting their scale of effect, produced a potential range 55.9{\%} smaller than that predicted using the climatic model alone, suggesting a systematic overestimation in many published predictions. This general framework illustrated by a well-documented invasive species is applicable to other taxa and scenarios of future climate and land-cover changes.},

abstract = {Congeneric species often have similar ecological characteristics and use similar resources. These similarities may make it easier for them to co-occur in a similar habitat but may also lead to strong competitions that limit their coexistence. Hence, how do similarities in congeneric species affect their coexistence exactly? This study mainly used spatial point pattern analysis in two 1 hm2 plots in the Baotianman National Nature Reserve, Henan, China, to compare the similarities in spatial distributions and interspecific associations of Quercus species. Results revealed that Quercus species were all aggregated under the complete spatial randomness null model, and aggregations were weaker under the heterogeneous Poisson process null model in each plot. The interspecific associations of Quercus species to non-Quercus species were very similar in Plot 1. However, they can be either positive or negative in different plots between the co-occurring Quercus species. The spatial distributions of congeneric species, interspecific associations with non-Quercus species, neighborhood richness around species, and species diversity were all different between the two plots. We found that congeneric species did have some similarities, and the closely related congeneric species can positive or negative associate with each other in different plots. The co-occurring congeneric species may have different survival strategies in different habitats. On the one hand, competition among congenerics may lead to differentiation in resource utilization. On the other hand, their similar interspecific associations can strengthen their competitive ability and promote local exclusion to noncongeneric species to obtain more living space. Our results provide new knowledge for us to better understand the coexistence mechanisms of species. {\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

Shrubs play a key role in biogeochemical cycles, prevent soil and water erosion, provide forage for livestock, and are a source of food, wood and non-wood products. However, despite their ecological and societal importance, the influence of different environmental variables on shrub distributions remains unclear.Weevaluated the influence of climate and soil characteristics, and whether including soil variables improved the performance of a species distribution model (SDM), Maxent. Methods. This study assessed variation in predictions of environmental suitability for 29 Australian shrub species (representing dominant members of six shrubland classes) due to the use of alternative sets of predictor variables. Models were calibrated with (1) climate variables only, (2) climate and soil variables, and (3) soil variables only. Results. The predictive power of SDMs differed substantially across species, but generally models calibrated with both climate and soil data performed better than those calibrated only with climate variables. Models calibrated solely with soil variables were the least accurate. We found regional differences in potential shrub species richness across Australia due to the use of different sets of variables. Conclusions. Our study provides evidence that predicted patterns of species richness may be sensitive to the choice of predictor set when multiple, plausible alternatives exist, and demonstrates the importance of considering soil properties when modeling availability of habitat for plants.},

abstract = {The banded ironstone formation (BIF) ranges of south-western Australia are prominent landforms in a flat landscape and host a diverse flora. Plant diversity is expected to have a positive relationship with environmental heterogeneity in these ranges. However, there has been a lack of high-resolution data to assess how fine-scale environmental variation structures changes in plant communities across these ranges. We calculated species richness and corrected weighted endemism over 659 quadrats (each 400 m2) and investigated their spatial distribution across BIFs in relation to 1 m resolution variables (microtopographic heterogeneity, solar radiation and topographic wetness) using geographically weighted regression. Microtopographic heterogeneity was most strongly related to richness and endemism, but this association was spatially variable at short distances across BIFs: relationships were negative or weakly positive on north-eastern range sections, whereas positive associations became progressively stronger further south and west on central, western and southern sections. Negative solar radiation-plant associations were reduced in these areas, likely because metre-scale surface variation moderates insolation. Topographic wetness-plant associations were negative on BIFs, but positive on the surrounding plains. The presence of fine-scale, geographically variant heterogeneity-diversity relationships in other locations would be difficult to detect if high-resolution environmental data are not used, with the implication that conservation decision-making may be compromised. Given climatic warming predicted for south-western Australia and other regions globally, a similar approach to that applied here can contribute to conservation by identifying locations likely to act as micro-buffers against warming.},

abstract = {We created a new dataset of spatially interpolated monthly climate data for global land areas at a very high spatial resolution (approximately 1 km2). We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15{\%} (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

abstract = {Using new tools (boosted regression trees) in predictive biogeography, with extensive spatial 23 distribution data for {\textgreater} 19 000 species, we developed predictive models for South African plant species richness patterns. Further, biome level analysis explored possible functional determinants of country-wide regional species richness. Finally, to test model reliability independently, we predicted potential alien invasive plant species richness with an independent dataset. Amongst the different hypotheses generally invoked to explain species 30 diversity (energy, favorableness, topographic heterogeneity, irregularity and seasonality), results revealed topographic heterogeneity as the most powerful single explanatory variable for indigenous South African plant species richness. Some biome-specific responses were observed, i.e. two of the five analyzed biomes (Fynbos and Grassland) had richness best explained by the "species-favorableness" hypothesis, but even in this case, topographic heterogeneity was also a primary predictor. This analysis, the largest conducted on an almost exhaustive species sample in a species-rich region, demonstrates the preeminence of topographic heterogeneity in shaping the spatial pattern of regional plant species richness. Model reliability was confirmed by the considerable predictive power for alien invasive species richness. It thus appears that topographic heterogeneity controls species richness in two main ways: firstly, by providing an abundance of ecological niches in contemporary space (revealed by alien invasive species richness relationships) and secondly, by facilitating the persistence of ecological niches through time. The extraordinary richness of the South African Fynbos biome, a world-renowned hotspot of biodiversity with the steepest environmental gradients in South Africa, may thus have arisen through both mechanisms. Comparisons with similar regions of the world outside South Africa are needed to confirm the generality of topographic heterogeneity and favorableness as predictors of plant richness.},

abstract = {The Cape flora of South Africa grows in a continental area with many diverse and endemic species. We need to understand the evolutionary origins and ages of such 'hotspots' to conserve them effectively. In volcanic islands the timing of diversification can be precisely measured with potassium-argon dating. In contrast, the history of these continental species is based upon an incomplete fossil record and relatively imprecise isotopic palaeotemperature signatures. Here we use molecular phylogenetics and precise dating of two island species within the same clade as the continental taxa to show recent speciation in a species-rich genus characteristic of the Cape flora. The results indicate that diversification began approximately 7-8 Myr ago, coincident with extensive aridification caused by changes in ocean currents. The recent origin of endemic species diversity in the Cape flora shows that large continental bursts of speciation can occur rapidly over timescales comparable to those previously associated with oceanic island radiations.},

abstract = {Vegetation and its correlation with environment has been traditionally studied at a single scale of observation. If different ecological processes are dominant at different spatial and temporal scales, the results obtained from such observations will be specific to the single scale of observation employed and will lack generality. Consequently, it is important to assess whether the processes that determine community structure and function are similar at different scales, or whether, how rapidly, and under what circumstances the dominant processes change with scale of observation. Indeed, early work by Greig-Smith and associates (Greig-Smith 1952; Austin {\&} Greig-Smith 1968; see Greig-Smith 1979; Kershaw {\&} Looney 1985; Austin {\&} Nicholls 1988) suggested that plant-plant interactions are typically important at small scales, but that the physical environment dominates at large scales. Using a gridded and mapped 6.6 ha portion of the Duke Forest on the North Carolina piedmont for a case study, we examined the importance of scale in vegetation studies by testing four hypotheses. First, we hypothesized that the correlation between vegetation composition and environment should increase with increasing grain (quadrat) size. Our results support this hypothesis. Second, we hypothesized that the environmental factors most highly correlated with species composition should be similar at all grain sizes within the 6.6-ha study area, and should be among the environmental factors strongly correlated with species composition over the much larger extent of the ca. 3500 ha Duke Forest. Our data are not consistent with either portion of this hypothesis. Third, we hypothesized that at the smaller grain sizes employed in this study ({\textless} 256 m2), the composition of the tree canopy should contribute significantly to the vegetation pattern in the under-story. Our results do not support this hypothesis. Finally, we predicted that with increased extent of sampling, the correlation between environment and vegetation should increase. Our data suggest the opposite may be true. This study confirms that results of vegetation analyses can depend greatly on the grain and extent of the samples employed. Whenever possible, sampling should include a variety of grain sizes and a carefully selected sample extent so as to ensure that the results obtained are robust. Application of the methods used here to a variety of vegetation types could lead to a better understanding of whether different ecological processes typically dominate at different spatial scales.},

abstract = {Closely related species that occur together in commu- nities and experience similar environmental conditions are likely to share phenotypic traits because of the process of environmental fil- tering. At the same time, species that are too similar are unlikely to co-occur because of competitive exclusion. In an effort to explain the coexistence of 17 oak species within forest communities in North Central Florida, we examined correlations between the phylogenetic relatedness of oak species, their degree of co-occurrence within com- munities and niche overlap across environmental gradients, and their similarity in ecophysiological and life-history traits. We show that the oaks are phylogenetically overdispersed because co-occurring spe- cies are more distantly related than expected by chance, and oaks within the same clade show less niche overlap than expected. Hence, communities are more likely to include members of both the red oak and the white?live oak clades than only members of one clade. This pattern of phylogenetic overdispersion arises because traits im- portant for habitat specialization show evolutionary convergence.We hypothesize further that certain conserved traits permit coexistence of distantly related congeners. These results provide an explanation for how oak diversity is maintained at the community level in North Central Florida},

abstract = {Landscapes of the eastern Cape Floristic Region are extremely rich in biomes. Analysis of the determinants of boundaries between biomes can generate insights and predictions that are useful for the applied ecological sciences. Here we used a historical data set and multivariate methods to explore the determinants of the boundaries of Forest, Fynbos, Grassland, Renosterveld and Thicket biomes in a 1200 km2 area of the Kouga region. The data set comprised 203 (10 m × 10 m) sites with corresponding landscape-scale environmental variables, and 100 sites with corresponding site-bound edaphic (physical and chemical) variables. Of the landscape variables, soil drainage and fire exposure had the strongest biome-specific associations: most Grassland occurred on seasonally waterlogged soils and Renosterveld on moderately drained soils. While Forest was exclusively associated with landscapes protected from fire, much Fynbos and Thicket were found in areas exposed to fires of intermediate frequency; however, in these situations Fynbos is restricted to sandstone-derived soils and thicket to shale-derived soils. Other strong patterns were the restriction of Forest to sandstone-derived soils and of Thicket to soils of deep to intermediate depth. Soils of the majority of Fynbos and Grassland were shallow, rocky and infertile, while those of Forest and Thicket were deep, rock-free and fertile, especially in terms of oxidizable carbon and total nitrogen. The relatively high fertility of Forest and Thicket soils is attributed canopy-induced enrichment in the prolonged absence of fire. Renosterveld occupied soils of intermediate fertility. These patterns can provide useful insights for developing experimental approached to simultaneously assess the determinants of multiple boundaries in the biome-rich landscape of the eastern Cape Floristic Region.},

Here I ask whether the explanation may lie in the grain of the environment at which G x E is expressed. The grain (or grain size) of the environment refers to the scale of environmental heterogeneity relative to generation time - that is, relative to the window of operation of selection - with higher rates of heterogeneity occurring in finer-grained environments. The hypothesis that the grain of the environment explains variation in the expression of G x E encapsulates variation in the power of selection to shape reaction norms: selection should be able to erode G x E in fine-grained environments but lose its power as the grain becomes coarser. I survey studies of G x E in sexual traits and demonstrate that the strength of G x E varies with the grain of the environment across which it is expressed, with G x E being stronger in coarser-grained environments. This result elucidates when G x E is most likely to be sustained in the reaction norms of fitness-related traits and when its evolutionary consequences will be most pronounced.},

abstract = {The flora of southern Africa is, for its latitude and area, very species-rich. Although the hyperdiverse Cape flora contributes almost half of this richness, three other radiations (desert, grassland, and woodland) contribute significantly to the botanical wealth of southern Africa. Each radiation occurs in a different ecological setting and has a different diversification history. Such parallel radiations can develop in suitably complex environments, given gradual change through time and no region-wide catastrophes. These four radiations cross-seeded each other, with clades spawning subclades in other radiations, thus linking all four into one complex radiation. This led to an increase in the number of diversifying clades in each radiation. Such complex radiations accumulate diversifying lineages over a long time, spawn daughter radiations on other continents, and become powerhouses of global-biodiversity generation. We suggest that several of the most species-rich regions may harbor such complex radiations.},

abstract = {AimAlthough all five of the major mediterranean-climate ecosystems (MCEs) of the world are recognized as loci of high plant species diversity and endemism, they show considerable variation in regional-scale richness. Here, we assess the role of stable Pleistocene climate and Cenozoic topography in explaining variation in regional richness of the globe's MCEs. We hypothesize that older, more climatically stable MCEs would support more species, because they have had more time for species to accumulate than MCEs that were historically subject to greater topographic upheavals and fluctuating climates. LocationSouth-western Africa (Cape), south-western Australia, California, central Chile and the eastern (Greece) and western (Spain) Mediterranean Basin. MethodsWe estimated plant diversity for each MCE as the intercepts of species-area curves that are homogeneous in slope across all regions. We used two down-scaled global circulation models of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to quantify climate stability by comparing the change in the location of MCEs between the LGM and present. We quantified the Cenozoic topographic stability of each MCE by comparing contemporary topographic profiles with those present in the late Oligocene and the early Pliocene. ResultsThe most diverse MCEs - Cape and Australia - had the highest Cenozoic environmental stability, and the least diverse - Chile and California - had the lowest stability. Main conclusionsVariation in plant diversity in MCEs is likely to be a consequence not of differences in diversification rates, but rather the persistence of numerous pre-Pliocene clades in the more stable MCEs. The extraordinary plant diversity of the Cape is a consequence of the combined effects of both mature and recent radiations, the latter associated with increased habitat heterogeneity produced by mild tectonic uplift in the Neogene.},

In this paper we review, develop, and differentiate among concepts associated wit environmental patterning (patch, division, and heterogeneity), spatial and tempor scales of ecological processes (ecological neighborhoods), and responses of organ to environmental patterning (relative patch size, relative patch duration, rela patch isolation, and grain response). We generalize the concept of ecological neigh borhoods to represent regions of activity or influence during periods of time ap priate to particular ecological processes. Therefore, there is no single ecological neighborhood for any given organism, but rather a number of neighborhoods, each appropriate to different processes. Neighborhood sizes can be estimated by examin-ing the cumulative distribution of activity or influence of an organism as a function of increasingly large spatial units. The spatial and temporal dimensions of neighbor-hoods provide the scales necessary for assessing environmental patterning relative to particular ecological processes for a given species. Consistent application of the neighborhood concept will assist in the choice of appropriate study units, compari-sons among different studies, and comparisons between empirical studies and the-oretical postulates.},

Multiple scales of patchiness and patch structure: a hierarchical framework for the study of heterogeneity. -Oikos 59: 253-260. We develop a hierarchical model of heterogeneity that provides a framework for classifying patch structure across a range of scales. Patches at lower levels in the hierarchy are more simplistic and correspond to the traditional view of patches. At levels approaching the upper bounds of the hierarchy the internal structure becomes more heterogeneous and boundaries more ambiguous. At each level in the hierarchy, patch structure will be influenced by both contrast among patches as well as the degree of aggregation of patches at lower levels in the hierarchy. We apply this model to foraging theory, but it has wider applications as in the study of habitat selection, population dynamics, and habitat fragmentation. It may also be useful in expanding the realm of landscape ecology beyond the current focus on anthropocentric scales.},

abstract = {Understanding how species diversity is maintained is a foundational problem in ecology and an essential requirement for the discipline to be effective as an applied science. Ecologists' understanding of this problem has rapidly matured, but this has exposed profound uncertainty about the spatial scales required to maintain species diversity. Here we define and develop this frontier by proposing the coexistence–area relationship—a real relationship in nature that can be used to understand the determinants of the scale-dependence of diversity maintenance. The coexistence–area relationship motivates new empirical techniques for addressing important, unresolved problems about the influence of demographic stochasticity, environmental heterogeneity and dispersal on scale-dependent patterns of diversity. In so doing, this framework substantially reframes current approaches to spanding of the maintenance of diversity in nature, and should improve the contribution of community ecology to biodiversity conservation. Our understanding of how species diversity is maintained depends on spatial scale. Here, the coexistence–area relationship is developed to understand scale dependence and increase community ecology's contribution to biodiversity conservation.},

Using boosted regression trees that handle non-linear relationships, we compared the relative influence (as a measure of effectiveness) of environmental variables related to climate, landscape (or habitat heterogeneity), land-use intensity or energy availability to explain European vertebrate species richness (birds, amphibians, and mammals) at the continental and ecoregion scales. We found that dominant land cover and actual evapotranspiration that relate to energy availability were the main correlates of vertebrate species richness over Europe. At the ecoregion scale, we identified four distinct groups of ecoregions where species richness was essentially associated to (i) seasonality of temperature, (ii) actual evapotranspiration and/or mean annual temperature, (iii) seasonality of precipitation, actual evapotranspiration and land cover) and (iv) and an even combination of the environmental variables. This typology of ecoregions remained valid for total vertebrate richness and the three vertebrate groups taken separately. Despite the overwhelming influence of land cover and actual evapotranspiration to explain vertebrate species richness patterns at European scale, the ranking of the main correlates of species richness varied between regions. Interestingly, landscape and land-use indicators did not stand out at the continental scale but their influence greatly increased in southern ecoregions, revealing the long-lasting human footprint on land-use-land-cover changes. Our study provides one of the first multi-scale descriptions of the variability in the ranking of correlates across several taxa.},

abstract = {AimTo reconstruct the historical assembly of the eudicot flora of Mediterranean sierras by examining compositional (CBD), phylogenetic (PBD) and functional (FBD) beta diversity between elevational belts among disjunct mountain ranges (sierras), and relating these measures of turnover to environmental and geographical distances. LocationBaetic ranges, Andalusia, southern Spain. MethodsWe compiled eudicot species and subspecies (entities') checklists for three elevational belts within each of eight sierras of Andalusia (sites') and tested for non-random patterns of PBD and FBD of all entities and of endemic entities separately among sites between and within sierras. Multiple regression on distance matrices was used to determine the respective contribution of climate, lithology and geographical distance to CBD, PBD and FBD. Finally, we decomposed PBD into the turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity, and quantified the phylogenetic diversity (PD) within sites. ResultsThe observed PBD and FBD among elevational belts within sierras for all entities were generally higher than expected based on their respective null distributions, whereas CBD among elevational belts within sierras was similar or even lower than between sierras. In contrast, the observed PBD and FBD for endemics were non-significant in most of the comparisons. Temperature-related variables best explained patterns of CBD, PBD and FBD for all entities, whereas lithology and geographical distance were the main drivers of endemic CBD. The observed PBD among elevational belts within sierras was mainly attributable to differences in PD rather than true' turnover. Main conclusionsThere is strong structuring of plant lineages along elevational gradients in the Baetic range, probably due to habitat filtering acting on life forms and character syndromes that show strong phylogenetic signal. The differentiation of the endemic flora that contributed to the emergence of this western Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot was probably driven by geographical isolation and/or by repeated specialization to contrasting lithologies.},

abstract = {Abstract Information on the distribution of animal populations is essential for conservation planning and management. Unfortunately, shared coordinate-level data may have the potential to compromise sensitive species and generalized data are often shared instead to facilitate knowledge discovery and communication regarding species distributions. Sharing of generalized data is, unfortunately, often ad hoc and lacks scalable conventions that permit consistent sharing at larger scales and varying resolutions. One common convention in African applications is the Quarter Degree Grid Cells (QDGC) system. However, the current standard does not support unique references across the Equator and Prime Meridian. We present a method for extending QDGC nomenclature to support unique references at a continental scale for Africa. The extended QDGC provides an instrument for sharing generalized biodiversity data where laws, regulations or other formal considerations prevent or prohibit distribution of coordinate-level information. We recommend how the extended QDGC may be used as a standard, scalable solution for exchange of biodiversity information through development of tools for the conversion and presentation of multi-scale data at a variety of resolutions. In doing so, the extended QDGC represents an important alternative to existing approaches for generalized mapping and can help planners and researchers address conservation issues more efficiently.

abstract = {Energy and habitat heterogeneity are important correlates of spatial variation in species richness, though few investigations have sought to determine simultaneously their relative influences. Here we use the South African avifauna to examine the extent to which species richness is related to these variables and how these relationships depend on spatial grain. Taking spatial autocorrelation and area effects into account, we find that primary productivity, precipitation, absolute minimum temperature, and, at coarser resolutions, habitat heterogeneity account for most of the variation in species richness. Species richness and productivity are positively related, whereas the relationship between potential evapotranspiration (PET) and richness is unimodal. This is largely because of the constraining effects of low rainfall on productivity in high-PET areas. The increase in the importance of vegetation heterogeneity as an explanatory variable is caused largely by an increase in the range of vegetation heterogeneity included at coarse resolutions and is probably also a result of the positive effects of environmental heterogeneity on species richness. Our findings indicate that species richness is correlated with, and hence likely a function of, several variables, that spatial resolution and extent must be taken into account during investigations of these relationships, and that surrogate measures for productivity should be interpreted cautiously.},

abstract = {How species richness relates to environmental gradients at large extents is commonly investigated aggregating local site data to coarser grains. However, such relationships often change with the grain of analysis, potentially hiding the local signal. Here we show that a novel network technique, the “method of reflections”, could unveil the relationships between species richness and climate without such drawbacks. We introduced a new index related to potential species richness, which revealed large scale patterns by including at the local community level information about species distribution throughout the dataset (i.e., the network). The method effectively removed noise, identifying how far site richness was from potential. When applying it to study woody species richness patterns in Spain, we observed that annual precipitation and mean annual temperature explained large parts of the variance of the newly defined species richness, highlighting that, at the local scale, communities in drier and warmer areas were potentially the species richest. Our method went far beyond what geographical upscaling of the data could unfold, and the insights obtained strongly suggested that it is a powerful instrument to detect key factors underlying species richness patterns, and that it could have numerous applications in ecology and other fields.},

@article{Mateo2017,
abstract = {Improving biodiversity predictions is essential if we are to meet the challenges posed by global change. As knowledge is key to feed models, we need to evaluate how debated theory can affect models. An important ongoing debate is whether environmental constraints limit the number of species that can coexist in a community (saturation), with recent findings suggesting that spe-cies richness in many communities might be unsaturated. Here, we propose that biodiversity models could address this issue by accounting for a duality: considering communities as unsaturated but where species composition is constrained by different scale-dependent biodiversity drivers. We identify a variety of promising advances for incorporating this duality into commonly applied biodiversity modelling approaches and improving their spatial predictions. A recent debate [1,2] has revived an old discussion in ecology: are communities 'saturated'? Is there a limit to the number of species that a community (see Glossary) can support? Whether saturation plays a role in shaping communities remains a fundamental issue widely assessed in ecology and evolution, but no formal consensus has been reached (see Figure I in Box 1). If saturation occurs, is it caused by ecological limits or by geographic area? In particular, are communities constrained by an 'environmental carrying capacity' (ECC) that limits the number of coexisting species? Answering this overarching saturation question is not only crucial from a fundamental per-spective, but also constitutes a major challenge for the biodiversity models used to predict current and future patterns of species composition and richness. Here, we do not intend to continue or solve the saturation debate per se, but we aim instead to assess the key implications that this question has for modelling communities (see Outstanding Questions), particularly taking a spatial and temporal perspective.},

abstract = {Background Soils are widely recognized as a non-renewable natural resource and as biophysical carbon sinks. As such, there is a growing requirement for global soil information. Although several global soil information systems already exist, these tend to suffer from inconsistencies and limited spatial detail. Methodology/Principal Findings We present SoilGrids1km — a global 3D soil information system at 1 km resolution — containing spatial predictions for a selection of soil properties (at six standard depths): soil organic carbon (g kg−1), soil pH, sand, silt and clay fractions ({\%}), bulk density (kg m−3), cation-exchange capacity (cmol+/kg), coarse fragments ({\%}), soil organic carbon stock (t ha−1), depth to bedrock (cm), World Reference Base soil groups, and USDA Soil Taxonomy suborders. Our predictions are based on global spatial prediction models which we fitted, per soil variable, using a compilation of major international soil profile databases (ca. 110,000 soil profiles), and a selection of ca. 75 global environmental covariates representing soil forming factors. Results of regression modeling indicate that the most useful covariates for modeling soils at the global scale are climatic and biomass indices (based on MODIS images), lithology, and taxonomic mapping units derived from conventional soil survey (Harmonized World Soil Database). Prediction accuracies assessed using 5–fold cross-validation were between 23–51{\%}. Conclusions/Significance SoilGrids1km provide an initial set of examples of soil spatial data for input into global models at a resolution and consistency not previously available. Some of the main limitations of the current version of SoilGrids1km are: (1) weak relationships between soil properties/classes and explanatory variables due to scale mismatches, (2) difficulty to obtain covariates that capture soil forming factors, (3) low sampling density and spatial clustering of soil profile locations. However, as the SoilGrids system is highly automated and flexible, increasingly accurate predictions can be generated as new input data become available.

This review discusses patterns and determinants of local, differential and regional plant diversity in all five regions. Local diversity shows great variation within and between regions and explanations for these patterns invoke a wide range of hypotheses. Patterns of regional diversity are the result of differential speciation and extinction rates during the Quaternary. These rates have been influenced more by the incidence of fire and the severity of climate change than by environmental heterogeneity. All regions have a high number of rare and locally endemic taxa that survive as small populations, many of which are threatened by habitat transformation.},

abstract = {To understand the generation and maintenance of biodiversity hotspots, we tested three major hypotheses: rates of diversification, ecological limits to diversity, and time for species accumulation.
Using dated molecular phylogenies, measures of species' range size and geographical clade overlap, niche modelling, and lineages-through-time plots of Australian Fabaceae, we compared the southwest Australia Floristic Region (SWAFR; a global biodiversity hotspot) with a latitudinally equivalent non-hotspot, southeast Australia (SEA).
Ranges of species (real and simulated) were smaller in the SWAFR than in SEA. Geographical overlap of clades was significantly greater for Daviesia in the SWAFR than in SEA, but the inverse for Bossiaea. Lineage diversification rates over the past 10 Myr did not differ between the SWAFR and SEA in either genus.
Interaction of multiple factors probably explains the differences in measured diversity between the two regions. Steeper climatic gradients in the SWAFR probably explain the smaller geographical ranges of both genera there. Greater geographical overlap of clades in the SWAFR, combined with a longer time in the region, can explain why Daviesia is far more species-rich there than in SEA. Our results indicate that the time for speciation and ecological limits hypotheses, in concert, can explain the differences in biodiversity.},

abstract = {1. Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. 2. This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3. Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and auto- matically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods. 4. The unique features of BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel ( Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.},

Where foliar concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and sodium (Na) showed strong phylogenetic signal, as did the foliar ratios of these nutrients to P, this was not true of the corresponding soil values. In addition, although foliar traits were often related to soil values, the coefficients of determination were consistently low. These results identify foliar stoichiometry as having a strong genetic component, with variation in foliar nutrient concentrations, especially [P] and [K], being identified as potentially adaptive. Comparison of stoichiometric variation across 11 similarly-aged clades revealed consistently low foliar nutrient concentrations in lineages showing specialization to extremely low-nutrient fynbos heathlands. These lineages also display lower rates of evolution of these traits as well as a reduced tendency for foliar [P] to track soil [P]. Reduced evolutionary lability and adaptability in the nutritional traits of fynbos-specialist lineages may explain the floristic distinctness of the fynbos flora and also implies a reduced scope for edaphically-driven ecological speciation.},

abstract = {The mechanisms that shape plant diversity along resource gradients remain unresolved because competing theories have been evaluated in isolation. By testing multiple theories simultaneously across a {\textgreater}2-million-year dune chronosequence in an Australian biodiversity hotspot, we show that variation in plant diversity is not explained by local resource heterogeneity, resource partitioning, nutrient stoichiometry, or soil fertility along this strong resource gradient. Rather, our results suggest that diversity is determined by environmental filtering from the regional flora, driven by soil acidification during long-term pedogenesis. This finding challenges the prevailing view that resource competition controls local plant diversity along resource gradients, and instead reflects processes shaping species pools over evolutionary time scales.},

abstract = {Aim Relatively few models of species richness explicitly consider aspects of environmental heterogeneity, other than topographic heterogeneity. We hypothesized that environmental heterogeneity is an important determinant of species richness, especially in ancient climatically stable environments. Location South Africa, which accommodates a range of biomes that differ strongly in species richness. Methods We included measures of climatic, edaphic and biotic variables and their spatial heterogeneities in boosted regression tree models of vascular plant species richness. Species richness was assessed using herbarium records per quarter degree square (QDS). To avoid autocorrelation and problems of vari- able collection rates we iteratively randomly subsampled 20{\%} of the available QDS. We also verified estimates of species richness using an independent data source. Results The models predicted 68{\%} of QDS species richness and 95{\%} of biome richness. Spatial variability in diurnal temperature range was the strongest pre- dictor of species richness, and inclusion of edaphic and biotic terms as well as spatial heterogeneities increased the explanatory power of the model consider- ably. Heterogeneity variables featured strongly (8 of 13) as predictors of species richness, but several resource variables (e.g. precipitation, seasonality and evap- otranspiration) were also important. The spatial heterogeneities of some vari- ables (e.g. water availability, fire) were related to their mean values, possibly explaining why some global models that have not explicitly included hetero- geneity (other than topographic) perform well. Main conclusions Environmental heterogeneities are important predictors of species richness, yielding accurate predictions even in the absence of any con- sideration of diversification rates or environmental stability. Greater hetero- geneity of some resource variables when limiting, contributed to modelled species richness, adding to understanding of why species richness of some resource-poor Mediterranean-ecosystems is high. We suggest that species rich- ness in ancient, climatically stable Mediterranean-ecosystems is contingent on resource and environmental heterogeneity that has enabled both the diversifica- tion and maintenance of regional species richness.},

abstract = {The species richness of the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) reflects a complex evolutionary history as well as extreme habitat heterogeneity. This chapter argues that two main components of habitat heterogeneity are (1) the variability across the CFR in the prevalence of hot, dry summers and wet winters and (2) the edaphic diversity due the complex geological development of the CFR resulting in juxtaposition of relatively nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor soils. In addition, fire frequency/intensity is topographically and climatically determined and flammability is an important emergent property of some components of CFR vegetation. These sources of heterogeneity, together with biotic interactions (not explored in this chapter) are responsible for maintaining high niche diversity, which has driven a large number of ecophysiological specializations in the flora. These include specializations for the acquisition of resources, e.g. cluster roots to acquire P, succulence to store ephemerally available water, and conservation of resources, e.g. sclerophylly to conserve nutrients, small leaves to conserve water during summer. This chapter argues that the high diversity of ecophysiological niches in the CFR is important in maintaining species richness of the CFR.},

In this context, remote sensing data should be the preferred choice, particularly when model transferability to novel climates or inferences on causality are invoked.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Plants, with an estimated 300,000 species, provide crucial primary production and ecosystem structure. To date, our quantitative understanding of diversity gradients of megadiverse clades such as plants has been hampered by the paucity of distribution data. Here, we investigate the global-scale species-richness pattern of vascular plants and examine its environmental and potential historical determinants. Across 1,032 geographic regions worldwide, potential evapotranspiration, the number of wet days per year, and measurements of topographical and habitat heterogeneity emerge as core predictors of species richness. After accounting for environmental effects, the residual differences across the major floristic kingdoms are minor, with the exception of the uniquely diverse Cape Region, highlighting the important role of historical contingencies. Notably, the South African Cape region contains more than twice as many species as expected by the global environmental model, confirming its uniquely evolved flora. A combined multipredictor model explains ≈70{\%} of the global variation in species richness and fully accounts for the enigmatic latitudinal gradient in species richness. The models illustrate the geographic interplay of different environmental predictors of species richness. Our findings highlight that different hypotheses about the causes of diversity gradients are not mutually exclusive, but likely act synergistically with water–energy dynamics playing a dominant role. The presented geostatistical approach is likely to prove instrumental for identifying richness patterns of the many other taxa without single-species distribution data that still escape our understanding.},

abstract = {Aim Estimates of endemic and non-endemic native vascular plant species in each of the three Western Australian Botanical Provinces were made by East in 1912 and Beard in 1969. The present paper contains an updated assessment of species endemism in the State. Location Western Australia comprises one third of the continental Australian land mass. It extends from 13° to 35° S and 113° to 129° W. Methods Western Australia is recognized as having three Botanical Provinces (Northern, Eremaean and South-West) each divided into a number of Botanical Districts. Updated statistics for number of species and species endemism in each Province are based on the Census of Western Australian Plants data base at the Western Australian Herbarium (Western Australian Herbarium, 1998 onwards). Results The number of known species in Western Australia has risen steadily over the years but reputed endemism has declined in the Northern and Eremaean Provinces where cross-continental floras are common. Only the isolated South-West Province retains high rates of endemism (79{\%}). Main conclusions With 5710 native species, the South-West Province contains about the same number as the California Floristic Province which has a similar area. The Italian mediterranean zone also contains about this number but in a smaller area, while the much smaller Cape Floristic Region has almost twice as many native species. The percentage of endemic species is highest at the Cape, somewhat less in south-western Australia and less again in California. Italy, at 12.5{\%}, has the lowest value. Apart from Italy, it is usual for endemism to reach high values in the largest plant families. In Western Australia, these mainly include woody sclerophyll shrubs and herbaceous perennials with special adaptations to environmental conditions. While those life forms are prominent in the Cape, that region differs in the great importance of herbaceous families and succulents, both of which are virtually absent from Western Australia. In California and Italy, most endemics are in families of annual, herbaceous perennial and soft shrub plants. It is suggested that the dominant factor shaping the South-West Province flora is the extreme poverty of the area's soils, a feature that emphasizes sclerophylly, favours habitat specialization and ensures relatively many local endemic species.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Using phylogenies in community ecology is now commonplace, but typically, studies assume and test for a single common phylogenetic signal for all species in a community, at a given scale. A possibility that remains little-explored is that species differing in demographic or ecological attributes, or facing different selective pressures, show different community phylogenetic patterns, even within the same communities. Here I compare community phylogenetic patterns for fire-killed and fire-resistant Banksia species in the fire-prone shrublands of southwest Australia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Using new Bayesian phylogenies of Banksia, together with ecological trait data and abundance data from 24 field sites, I find that fire regeneration mode influences the phylogenetic and phenotypic signal of species co-occurrence patterns. Fire-killed species (reseeders) show patterns of phylogenetic and phenotypic repulsion consistent with competition-driven niche differentiation, but there are no such patterns for fire-resistant species (resprouters). For pairs of species that differ in fire response, co-occurrence is mediated by environmental filtering based on similarity in edaphic preferences.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that it may be simplistic to characterize an entire community by a single structuring process, such as competition or environmental filtering. For this reason, community analyses based on pairwise species co-occurrence patterns may be more informative than those based on whole-community structure metrics.},

abstract = {This chapter outlines the abiotic characteristics of the GCFR, principally its landscapes, rock types, and gradients of climate. These act together to produce a mosaic of environmental conditions which facilitate the differentiation of the GCFR into smaller physiographic units. The GCFR's latitudinal position (28°S to 35°S) together with its largely coastal position in the westerly wind belt ensures that it receives reliable winter rain and has relatively mild temperatures; however only the south west qualifies as a mediterranean-type climate. Northwards, temperature increases and rainfall decreases, while from west to east rainfall dominance changes from winter to summer. The alpine-like topography of the Cape Fold Belt produces localized, orographically induced exceptions to these general climate trends, notably a rapid increase in annual rainfall, and pronounced rain shadows. The Great Escarpment impedes the eastward penetration of winter rain and the westward penetration of summer rain, accentuating seasonal rainfall regimes. While the coast is mild, the escarpment is more extreme, as minimum temperatures decrease and maximum temperatures increase. Different rock types partition the climate gradients of the GCFR into more discrete physiographic units. Fynbos occurs on infertile siliceous sandstone soils associated with the Cape Fold Belt, while succulent karoo and renosterveld occur on more fertile, heavier soils of the coastal forelands and intermontane valleys. However, succulent karoo vegetation can occur on infertile sandstone soils, especially in the west where rainfall is very low. In the absence of fire, both forest and thicket can colonize infertile soils of the GCFR.},
