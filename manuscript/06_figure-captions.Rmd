(ref:roughness) Types of environmental heterogeneity, compared between the the Cape and SWA---namely for (a) elevation, (b) climatic variables, (c) NDVI and (d) soil variables---in each panel consisting of three sub-panels per variable type. The upper row of panels shows example distributions of roughness values (Equation \@ref(eq:roughness)), showing the different extremes in environmental heterogeneity observed in each region when compared at fine (0.05ยบ) and coarse (3QDS) scales. Each distribution has under it an area of one. Histograms were constructed using 20 breaks. In the lower row of panels, these distributions of roughness values were compared between the Cape and SWA at each of the four spatial scales, not just 0.05ยบ and 3QDS, using non-parametric Mann-Whitney $U$-tests to test for differences. The "common language effect size" ($CLES$, see text) describes these differences (b). $U$-tests for almost all environmental variables yielded significant differences ($P < 0.05$) between Cape and SWA values (NS, non-significant differences). CLES for 0.05 res. is for 5000 random cells in each region, as the Mann-Whitney $U$-test cannot handle more than a few thousand values per sample when comparing<!--TODO: reword-->.

(ref:turnover) Species turnover, described in two forms ((a) mean Jaccard distance between QDS in each HDS ($\overline{J}_{\mathrm{QDS}}$), (b) additively defined turnover ($T_{\mathrm{HDS}}$, Equation \@ref(eq:whittaker)) as a proportion of HDS richness ($S_{\mathrm{HDS}}$)), compared between the Cape and SWA. Mann-Whitney $U$-tests between the Cape and SWA distributions of $\overline{J}_{\mathrm{QDS}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{HDS}}$ yielded significant differences.

(ref:species-environment-relationships) Relative influence of environmental variables (including heterogeneity variables---prefixed with "R") in boosted regression tree (BRT) model predictions for the final six models' response variables in Greater Cape Floristic Region (Cape) and Southwest Australia Floristic Region (SWA): vascular plant species richness at the (b,e) QDS-scale, (a,d) HDS-scale and (c,f) turnover ($= \overline{J}_{\mathrm{QDS}}$). <!--Contributions here are treated as the relative influence (%) of variables on predictions [@Friedman2001AnnStatistics29(5):1189--1232].-->All BRT-models were permitted to fit three-way interactions between environmental variables<!--, with a learning rate of 0.001-->. Points denote the average contribution of an environmental variable to model-predictions across the 1000 replicate BRT-models for that region/scope. Horizontal ticks denote the average for the 999 permuted BRT-models. The standard deviations above and below these means are shown with vertical lines. Note that in the case of the replicate models they are very small in most cases, obsfucating them. Colour represents the general category of the environment (keyed) to which a variable belongs, as in Figure \@ref(fig:roughness)b. Piecharts inset display the same information (left-most piecharts), and additionally grouped according to whether a variable was absolute or roughness-transformed (right-most piecharts). $F$-statistics inset are for one-way ANOVAs of differences in variables' relative influences from the replicate ($F_{\mathrm{rep.}}$) and permuted ($F_{\mathrm{prm.}}$) BRT-models.<!--Variables along the horizontal axes appear at least once in each panel (i.e. were retained in at least one of the four models) and are sorted in order of importance within each panel. Where variables did not contribute to a model, they are shown as zero.--><!--TODO: reword-->

(ref:BRT-model-quality) Distributions of three measures of boosted regression tree (BRT) model performance (a) the number of trees in the model $nt$, (b) $R_{\mathrm{pseudo}}^2$ (Equation \@ref(eq:pseudo-R2)), (c) $R_{\mathrm{E-O}}^2$ (see text). These measures are presented for the six sets of permuted (pale bars) and six sets of replicate BRT-models (dark bars) as in Figure \@ref(fig:species-environment-relationships), coloured according to the region of interest as in Figures \@ref(fig:roughness)a and \@ref(fig:turnover). In all cases, replicate BRT-models almost entirely out-rank the permuted models in terms of performance (Table \@ref(tab:BRT-quality-perms)) and Cape and SWA models had significantly different values for each metric (Table \@ref(tab:BRT-quality-regions)). Note, the actual differences between Cape and SWA models' values is not realistically important in some cases<!--TODO: expand-->.

(ref:BRT-variable-rank-concordance) Differences in the rankings of environmental variables' (including heterogeneity variables) relative influences on boosted regression tree (BRT) model predictions of vascular plant species richness and turnover in (a) Cape and (b)<!--TODO: add lettering to panels--> SWA (as in Figure \@ref(fig:species-environment-relationships)). Each point represents an environmental variable's rank in BRT-model importance, decreasing in importance from left to right. Rankings used here are the same as that of the average relative influence for variables across replicate BRT-models, presented in Figure \@ref(fig:species-environment-relationships). Coloured lines connect points representing the same environmental variable. Points' outlines are coloured according to the general category of the environment (keyed) to which a variable belongs, as in Figuress \@ref(fig:roughness)b and \@ref(fig:species-environment-relationships), while points' centres are coloured according to whether a variable was roughness-transformed or not. The comparisons of variables' rankings of interest are between QDS- and HDS-scale richness (rows nos. 1 and 2) and between HDS-scale richness and turnover (rows nos. 2 and 3). Statistics ($\Delta$- and $P$-values) inset at the top and bottom of each panel refer to these comparisons respectively. $\Delta$-values represent the average absolute difference in ranks across variables between two models' rankings. The associate $P$-value results from ranking the observed $\Delta$-values against 999 $\Delta$-values based on random permutations of variables' rankings (SI1), such that more significant $P$-values denote rankings more similar than would be expected by chance.
