## Figure \@ref(fig:roughness) {-}

(ref:roughness) Types of environmental heterogeneity, compared between the the Cape and SWA---namely for (a) elevation, (b) climatic variables, (c) NDVI and (d) soil variables---in each panel consisting of three sub-panels per variable type.
The upper row of panels shows example distributions of roughness values (Equation \@ref(eq:roughness)), showing the different extremes in environmental heterogeneity observed in each region when compared at fine (0.05ยบ) and coarse (3QDS) scales.
Each distribution has under it area 1.
Histograms were constructed using 20 breaks.
In the lower row of panels, these distributions of roughness values were compared between the Cape and SWA at each of the four spatial scales, not just 0.05ยบ and 3QDS, using non-parametric Mann-Whitney $U$-tests to test for differences.
The "common language effect size" ($CLES$, see text) describes these differences (b).
$U$-tests for almost all environmental variables yielded significant differences ($P < 0.05$) between Cape and SWA values (NS, non-significant differences).

## Figure \@ref(fig:turnover) {-}

(ref:turnover) Species turnover, described in two forms ((a) mean Jaccard distance between QDS in each HDS ($\overline{J}_{QDS}$), (b) additively defined turnover ($T_{HDS}$, see Equation \@ref(eq:whittaker)) as a proportion of HDS richness ($S_{HDS}$)), compared between the Cape and SWA. Mann-Whitney $U$-tests between the Cape and SWA distributions of $\overline{J}_{QDS}$ and $T_{HDS}$ yielded significant differences.
