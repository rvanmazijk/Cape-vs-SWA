## Overview

These analyses required definitions of the boundaries of the two regions, environmental data for each, and geospatially-explicit vascular plant occurrence records, all based on publicly available data.
The environmental variables chosen (Table \@ref(tab:data-sources)) for this study were intended to cover a reasonable spread of climatic, edaphic, and ecologically relevant environmental axes, and are not intended to be exhaustive.
We selected variables describing topography (elevation), productivity (NDVI), soil status, and climate and climatic seasonality.

We carried out this investigation using four principal spatial scales: 0.05ยบ x 0.05ยบ squares (the finest common resolution among the environmental data sources used), quarter degree squares (QDS) [@Larsen2009], half degree squares (HDS) [@Larsen2009] and three-quarter degree squares (3QDS).
Note, at least for the Cape, most plant occurrence records are only accurate to QDS level.
Thus, any analysis involving species data was necessary limited to scales above and including QDS.
Analyses were performed in R v3.5.0 [@RCoreTeam2018].
Version-numbers of specific R packages used are presented in the bibliography, or in text where applicable.

## Environmental data sources

Geospatially-explicit raster layers were acquired for a selection of environmental variables (Table \@ref(tab:data-sources)), for the regions of interest.
Here, the GCFR was treated as the areas occupied by the Succulent Karoo and Fynbos biomes in the current delineation of South Africa's biome boundaries [@Mucina2006].
The SWAFR was treated as the areas occupied by the Southwest Australia savanna, Swan Coastal Plain Scrub and Woodlands, Jarrah-Karri forest and shrublands, Southwest Australia woodlands, Esperance mallee, and Coolgardie woodlands in the World Wildlife Fund Terrestrial Ecoregions dataset [@Olson2001] in order to closely match the currently delineated SWAFR [@Gioia2017, @Hopper2004].
For the sake of readability, we shall refer to the GCFR and SWAFR simply as the Cape and SWA from hereon.

Raster data were re-projected to a common coordinate reference: WGS84 [@WGS84], using the "rgdal" [@Bivand2017] package in R [@RCoreTeam2018].
All data were re-sampled to 0.05ยบ resolution using the "resample" function in the R package "raster" [@Hijmans2016], with the "bilinear" method.

An emphasis was made on using satellite-derived environmental data in this work, in order to minimise differences in data quality and methodologies between the Cape and SWA.
Additionally, satellite-derived data have been shown to benefit regional-scale species distribution models [@Deblauwe2016], thus motivating their use in this regional-scale study.
The environmental data used in this study were derived from NASA's SRTM digital elevation model [@Farr2007], NASA's MODIS/Terra spectroradiometric data for land surface temperature and NDVI, the Climate Hazards Group's CHIRPS rainfall dataset [@Funk2015], and the International Soil Reference and Information Centre's SoilGrids250m edaphic dataset [@Hengl2017] (Table \@ref(tab:data-sources)).
SRTM and MODIS are entirely derived from satellite measurements, whereas CHIRPS is interpolated from weather station data with satellite-derived radiometric measurements.
SoilGrids250m is a machine-learning derived product, based on soil measurements as a function of many covariates, including MODIS and STRM sources [see @Hengl2017], using random-forests and other classification-tree-based methods, including gradient-boosting.
For the soil data considered here (Table 1), we used depth-interval weighted average values as the value for a particular soil variable in a given place.

Climatic and spectral data arise from satellites monitoring properties of the Earth's surface through time.
We therefore use the mean annual values for rainfall, surface temperature, and NDVI across space in our analyses.

## Plant occurrence data

<!--Download-->

Geospatially-explicit records of vascular plant occurrences were downloaded from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, Table \@ref(tab:data-sources)).
Queries were made for tracheophyte records from within the borders of the Cape and SWA as treated here [@GBIFCape, @GBIFSWA].
Only records with defined species and intra-specific ranks were kept.
Intra-specific occurrences were treated as simply being representative of their species.
This resulted in `r richness$n_before_checks$GCFR` unique species names in the Cape, and `r richness$n_before_checks$SWAFR` in SWA.

<!--Remove bad names-->

We cleaned these data using the R package "taxise" [@Chamberlain2016, @R-taxize] to check that these species names had accepted-status among taxonomic databases.
I queried two major taxonomic databases: the Global Name Resolver (GNR)<!--TODO: ref--><!--which includes the following independent databases within its queries: NCB, BoLD, ITIS, BHL, EoL, Redlist, GROMS, RAMSAR, BIRDLIFE or other conservation related indices, Scratchpad, LifeDesk indices, Tropicos, Exemplar online Flora and Fauna, and Fauna Europaea (<https://github.com/GlobalNamesArchitecture/gni/wiki/Sources>)-->, and the Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (TNRS)<!--TODO: ref--><!--.
TNRS was built upon existing programmes from GNR, and includes a different (but not completely exclusive) set of databases (<http://tnrs.iplantcollaborative.org/sources.html>): Tropicos, The Global Compositae Checklist (GCC), USDA's Plants Database, NCBI, The International Legume Database and Information Service (ILDIS), The Plant List (Kew, Missouri Bot.
G.) (TPL), But without Fabaceae and Asteraceae (see IDLIS, GCC)).
The near-comprehensive coverage of the GNR and TNRS services combined motivated their use here.
Each unique species name from the GBIF-derived list for each region was queried against GNR and TNRS.
My implementation [TODO: please choose a different word here] to remove unaccepted names was forgiving [TODO: reword]-->.
Should one of either service return at least one match for a given name, then that name was deemed accepted.
Those names for which no full binomial matches were found in either database were excluded from the final list of species.
The number of species names excluded totalled at `r richness$n_bad_names$GCFR` and `r richness$n_bad_names$SWAFR` for the Cape and SWA respectively.
Especially for SWA, these numbers may be deemed appreciably high.
But, the occurrence records that would be dropped, as a consequence of these names' removals, seemed to be distributed randomly in geographic space in both regions.
<!--TODO: make this map? or at least quote a stat..?-->
As such, any effect of the loss of these records in this analysis is uniform within the two regions.

<!--Correct for synonymy-->

After the unaccepted names were removed, it was important to ensure that a species was not listed under multiple synonyms.
Such cases would skew the species richness data used in this study.
In light of this, the remaining names were queried in the Tropicos and Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) databases for their known synonyms, using "taxize".
These were collated to produce a nomenclatural "thesaurus" for the Cape and SWA species.
This consisted of a list of the accepted species names in a region, each associated with a list of known synonyms.
I amended species' names in the GBIF occurrence data, in order ensure species were listed under only one of these synonyms, as follows: For each entry in the thesaurus, for each synonym of that entry, if that synonym appeared in the GBIF species list, I replaced all appearances of that synonym in the species list with the original name from the thesaurus-entry that that synonym came from.

<!--Remove aliens-->

Lastly, I removed any species from both regions that are invasive aliens or non-indigenous.
Alien species lists for plants in South Africa and Australia were acquired from the IUCN's Global Invasive Species Database (<http://www.iucngisd.org/gisd/>).

<!--Final lists and rasters-->

The final total plant species richness in each region was `r richness$n_final$GCFR` and `r richness$n_final$SWAFR` for the Cape and SWA respectively.
These final collections of species occurrence records were converted to raster-layers, wherein pixel-values represented the species, genus and family richness of vascular plants within that pixel.
These rasters were produced at QDS, HDS, and 3QDS resolutions.

## Analyses

### Quantifying environmental heterogeneity

First, in order to assess predictions (i) and (ii), we needed to describe the EH in both regions.
Using the R package "raster" [@Hijmans2016], we used a modified version of the "roughness" index in the "terrain" function: for a three by three neighbourhood of cells, our index of roughness is the average square-root of the squared difference between each of the $n$ neighbour cells' values $x_i$ and the central focal cell's value $x_{focal}$:

\begin{equation}
  Roughness =
    \frac{1}{n}
    \sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}
          \left( x_{focal} - x_{i} \right)^{2}}
  (\#eq:roughness)
\end{equation}

Note, in order to use as much data from within regions' borders as possible, roughnes swas computed if a focal cell had at least one neighbour cell---that is, roughness is defined where $n_{x_{focal}} \geq 1$.
Using this index of heterogeneity, we produced raster layers of each of our nine environmental variable's heterogeneity.
We compared the distributions of roughness values in each variable in each region with non-parametric Mann-Whitney $U$-tests, as almost all variables could not be normalised by log-transformations.
We also compare the effect size of the Cape vs SWA using the "common language effect size" ($CLES$), using the R package "canprot".
The $CLES$ is the proportion of all pairwise comparisons between two sample groups' observations where one group's value is greater than the other.
In our case, of all pairwise comparisons of a variable's roughness values between the Cape and SWA, we calculated the CLES as the proportion of pairs where Cape roughness values were greater than that of SWA.
This allowed us to assess prediction (i).
To compare the spatial scales of heterogeneity (prediction (ii)) between each region, we repeated this analysis at all four spatial scales.
Once again, this entailed recalculating the roughness layer for each variable after the original layer (0.05 degrees resolution) had been rescaled to each of the coarser resolutions.

### Predicting richness and turnover with environmental heterogeneity

<!--Preamble-->

Regarding prediction (iii), we wished to compare the general degree of species turnover in each region.
For (iv) and (v) we modelled species richness ($S$) and turnover as a function of various combinations of environmental and environmental heterogeneity variables in both regions.

<!--Turnover comparisons-->

To compare the extent of species turnover between the Cape and SWA, we determined two metrics of species turnover.
The first, computes the mean species turnover as Jaccard distance [@R-vegan] between each pair of QDS within each HDS ($\overline{J}_{QDS}$, based on HDS with $2 \leq n \leq 4$ QDS) in both regions.
The second is defined in terms of Whittaker's additive definition of $\beta$-diversity [@ref], where

\begin{equation}
  \gamma = \alpha + \beta
  (\#eq:whittaker)
\end{equation}

Here, we treat species richness at the HDS-scale ($S_{HDS})$) as $\gamma$ and at the QDS-scale as $\alpha$.
Intuitively, the species richness of an area is the result of the richness of sites within that area and the difference in species complements between those sites.
Thus, we use here an additively defined residual turnover ($T_{HDS}$; i.e. $\beta = \alpha - \gamma$) as the proportion of $S_{HDS}$ unexplained by the mean species richness of HDS' constituent QDS ($\overline{S}_{QDS}$).
We compare the distributions of $\overline{J}_{QDS}$ and $T_{HDS}$ using non-parametric Mann-Whitney $U$-tests, in order to guard against non-normality.

_Boosted regression trees_

Boosted regression trees (BRTs) provide a machine learning-based model of response variables and do so without involving normal null-hypothesis significance testing. Here, two sets of BRT models were developed from the Protea Atlas occurrence records: BRTs for each of the 203 species of Proteaceae (i.e. SDMs) for which the results thereof were averaged by genus, and BRTs for each of the 13 genera directly, wherein occurrence data was used to create genus-level models. The latter can be thought of as genus distribution models, or GDMs hereafter.

BRT model construction was performed, as detailed by Elith et al. (2008) in R (v3.2.4; R Development Core Team, 2014) using the package gbm (v. 2.1.1; Ridgeway, 2007). Following iterative parameter optimisation for learning rate and tree complexity, Bernoulli BRT models were constructed with tree complexity = 5 (number of nodes of each tree), learning rate = 0.005 (shrinkage factor controlling the contribution of each tree to the final model), bagging fraction = 0.7 (proportion of training data randomly chosen to generate each tree) and cross-fold validation = 10 (i.e. use 10 different randomly selected training data sets). The total explained deviance was calculated as the difference between total and cross-validated deviance divided by the total deviance. The models were developed with all variables (those retained, above) and then simplified using the protocol suggested by Elith et al. (2008) to retain the minimum number of variables contributing to the models of each species or genus.

Following this model development, model quality was examined. Each model was evaluated to determine the receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC) score, and their Pseudo-R2. The models were used to predict the distribution of the species using the predict function in the package dismo (v1.0-15; Hijmans et al., 2014) using both the variables for current climate conditions and those for the future CIMP5 multi-model mean climate. These variables were always used in conjunction with the selected topographic and soils variables. The threshold (cut-off) to transform model predictions (probabilities) to a binary score (presence or absence) was determined on per-model basis (i.e. for each species or genus) using threshold in dismo, using the sensitivity score as the threshold.

_Relating species richness and environmental heterogeneity_

Boosted regression trees are a flexible machine-learning modelling technique [@Elith2008], that allow testing for relationships between a response and a set of predictors without the use of null-hypothesis significance testing [@Elith2008]. BRTs have been employed previously to model species richness [see @Mouchet2015; @Thuiller2006; @Cramer2016] as macro-ecological models. BRTs were implemented here to predict vascular plant species richness in each cell, as a function of environmental variables roughness-values in those cells, as a Gaussian response. BRT-models were developed for the GCFR, SWAFR, and for a merged dataset of both regions' data. This combined model included a discrete term for the region. These three regional-scopes were modelled with datasets at the QDS, HDS, and 3QDS resolutions derived from the original environmental data using bilinear resampling [@Hijmans2016]. The $log(x + 1)$-transform of species richness was used, in order to satisfy the assumptions of a Gaussian response. Note, this is not strictly because BRTs have any parametric assumptions concerning the distribution of the response variable, but rather to aid in applying the Gaussian-family of BRT algorithms to the richness data available.

BRTs are developed through the iterative generation of non-linear regression trees. BRTs are an ensemble-approach, in which a prediction is based on the weighted-sum of the predictions of progressively less important trees, as opposed to the predictions of one tree [@Elith2008]. This is representable as follows, with response $\hat{y}$, weights $w_i$, and regression-trees $T(X)_i$ (as functions of some matrix of predictor variables $X$), for $i \rightarrow nt$ number of trees:

$$ \label{2} \tag{2} \hat{y} = \sum_{i = 1}^{nt} w_i T(X)_i $$

\hfill

\noindent As recommended by @Elith2008, BRT models were trained on a set of non-collinear predictor variables, across a range of $tc$ and $lr$ settings, using `gbm.step` in the `dismo` [@Hijmans2017]. Collinear predictor variables can skew the interpretation of results, as the relatively influence of mutually collinear variables is reduced. Collinearity among the 17 environmental predictor variables and their respective 17 roughness-equivalents was assessed using `removeCollinearity` in the `R` package `virtualspecies` v1.4-2 [@Leroy2015], such that variables were no more than 75% collinear (Pearson's $r \geq 0.75$). When faced with a cluster of collinear variables, one variable was chosen manually therefrom (with the exception of NDVI and MLST, which were collinear, but it was considered desirable to include both, as NDVI was found to be an important predictor of species richness previously [@Cramer2016]). Where possible, the roughness-equivalent of an environmental variable was included if its absolute-equivalent could also be included. For the sake of comparison between regions' models, the same set of non-collinear predictor variables was used for training all models (Figure \ref{collinearity-checks}). The final predictor set consisted of (i) elevation, rough-elevation, NDVI, and rough-NDVI; (ii) the climatic variables MAP, rough-MAP, PDQ, rough-PDQ, PCV, rough-PCV, MLST, rough-MLST, TCQ, and rough-TCQ; and (iii) the edaphic variables CECSOL, rough-CECSOL, rough-OCDENS, BLDFIE, rough-BLDFIE, CRFVOL, rough-CRFVOL, CLYPPT, rough-CLYPPT, SLTPPT, and SNDPPT. When interpreting the results of BRTs, it is important to consider the effects of the variables included as representative of the effect of the excluded variables with which it is collinear---e.g. any interpretation of the effect of SNDPPT on species richness would then be also considered to be descriptive of the effect of soil pH on species richness (Figure \ref{collinearity-checks}).

BRTs have three important parameters that users have control over: the learning rate ($lr$) (i.e. the rate at which iterative trees reduce predictive deviance during model-training), tree complexity ($tc$) (i.e. the interaction depth), and the number of trees ($nt$)<!--the logic, the benefits, the motivation here, black-box models, partial-dependence plots, tol, $lr$, $tc$, How It Works(TM), etc.-->. In order to select ideal $lr$, $tc$ and $nt$, 25 candidate BRT-models (for each regional-scope, for each spatial scale) were trained on the final predictor set for a range of $tc$ values (1 to 5), and for each of those over a range of $lr$ values (0.001, 5 $\times$ 10^-4^, 1 $\times$ 10^-4^, 5 $\times$ 10^-5^, and 1 $\times$ 10^-5^). The function `gbm.step` optimises $nt$ using cross-validation during model training [@Elith2008] by halting iteration when predictions begin to overfit. For all models, I used 10 cross-validation folds, a tolerance-threshold of 5 $\times$ 10^-4^, a bagging-fraction of 0.75 (the default in `dismo`), and trained models starting with 1 tree, with each iterative step adding 1 tree, up to a maximum of 10,000 trees.

$$ \label{3} \tag{3} pseudo \ R^2 = 1 - \frac{model \ deviance}{null \ deviance} $$

\hfill

\noindent The optimum configuration of $lr$ and $tc$ for the final model is a trade-off between model fit (pseudo-$R^2$; Equation 3) and complexity ($nt$) (Figure \ref{all-models_r2_nt}). As the effect of $nt$ on pseudo-$R^2$ and $nt$ is negligibly small (Figure \ref{r2_nt_lr_tc}A), or non-significant (Figure \ref{r2_nt_lr_tc}B), a $tc$ of 5 was chosen for the final model. This follows the recommendations of @Elith2008, where $lr$ and $tc$ are advised to be adjusted inversely. This was chosen in order to account for the complex interactions determining species richness. To avoid overfitting, an intermediate $lr$ of 0.001 was chosen (Figure \ref{all-models_r2_nt}A). Thus, these configured models ($tc = 5, lr = 0.001$), for each regional-scope, for each spatial scale, were simplified further (using `gbm.simplify` in `dismo`), in order to remove predictor variables that contribute little, specific to each model. These simplified predictor sets produced by `gbm.simplify` were then used to re-train the models configured with $tc = 5, lr = 0.001$. These final 9 models (i.e. 3 regional-scopes across 3 spatial scales) are interpreted in this study.
