(ref:turnover-vs-geodist-model-table) Estimated coefficients and significances ($P$-value) following quantile regression of the 5%-quantile ($\tau = 0.05$) of pairwise species turnover (as Jaccards distance) as a function of the geographic distance (km, log-transformed) between QDS cells.
The Cape term represents the difference between Cape and SWA species turnover, for a given geographic distance.

```{r species-model-table-3QDS, results="asis"}
out <- my_model_table(
  model = species_turnover_richness_3QDS_m,
  tidy_terms = tidy_terms,
  AIC_table = species_3QDS_AIC_table
)
knitr::kable(
  out$model_table,
  align = c("l", "r", "r"),
  caption = "(ref:species-model-table-3QDS)"
)
```

(ref:species-model-table-3QDS) Estimated coefficients and significances ($P$-value) following multiple linear regression of 3QDS species richness ($S_{3QDS}$) against the mean QDS richness ($\overline{S_{QDS}}$) ($log(x + 1)$-transformed) and turnover ($\overline{J_{QDS}}$, as Jaccards distance) within a given HDS, of the form in Equation \@ref(eq:S-HDS-formula).
The Cape was fit as the baseline, hence the SWA represents the categorical term here.
<!--TODO: use SWA as baseline? to be more consistent w/ tab:turnover-vs-geodist-model-table-->
These models were better fitting than similar models without region categories ($\Delta AIC =$ `r out$deltaAIC`).
Note, this model does not represent those curves plot in Figures \@ref(fig:richness-vs-turnover)B,C and \@ref(fig:richness-vs-turnover-3QDS) (there, the curves are from simple linear regressions of the variables in each panel, separated by region).
