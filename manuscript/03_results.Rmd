## Describing environmental heterogeneity across scales

Across all variables considered, the Cape is more environmentally heterogeneous<!--(i.e. grid-cells are more different from each of their neighbouring cells)-->in the majority of pairwise comparisons of grid-cells ($CLES > 0.50$, Mann-Whitney $U$-test: $P < 0.05$, Figure \@ref(fig:roughness)). The Cape is thus more environmentally heterogeneous than SWA overall, but the degree to which it is more heterogeneous varies between environmental variables. These effects also vary somewhat with the spatial scale concerned. In some variables, the differentiation between Cape and SWA heterogeneity lessens at coarser scales (Figure \@ref(fig:roughness)b). Indeed, when comparing the overall ranking and medians of Cape vs SWA roughness values for each variable, we only find non-significant differences at the coarser 3QDS scale (Mann-Whitney $U$ tests, $P > 0.05$, Figure \@ref(fig:roughness)b).

Most obviously, and as expected, topographic heterogeneity is greatest in the Cape (Figure \@ref(fig:roughness)). Though SWA has a slightly wider distribution of elevational roughness values at coarse scales (e.g. 3QDS) compared to fine scales (0.05ยบ), so does the Cape. As such, the relative difference between the two regions seems invariant with spatial scale ($CLES \approx 0.95$, Figure \@ref(fig:roughness)b). This concurs with our expectations, as the Cape is mountainous and known to have steep elevational gradients [@ref], while SWA is much more topographically uniform.

Intuitively, then, elevation serves as a "benchmark test" for our comparisons of EH here, as it is well known and expected that the Cape should be more elevationally heterogeneous than SWA. Additionally, we can conclude that although there are greater extreme values of Cape elevational roughness at 0.05ยบ x 0.05ยบ scales, larger sections of land (i.e. 3QDS-cells) are are more different from each other in the Cape than the same sized sections are different from each other in SWA.

Climatic heterogeneity presents less differentiation between the Cape and SWA than elevational roughness (Figure \@ref(fig:roughness)a), though still the Cape predominates (Figure \@ref(fig:roughess)b). Notably, the difference between Cape and SWA mean annual rainfall and land surface temperature heterogeneity lessens when considered at coarse spatial scales (3QDS scale, Figure \@ref(roughness)b). Rainfall seasonality (PDQ), however, is similarly more heterogeneous in the Cape across all spatial scales considered.

Biological productivity, as measured by NDVI, varies spatially to a similar extent in the Cape and SWA (i.e. is more similarly heterogeneous, $CLES < 0.60$, Figure \@ref(fig:roughness)).

Concerning edaphic variables, the Cape and SWA are similarly heterogeneous at coarser scales, particularly in terms of CEC and Soil C (Figure \@ref(fig:roughness)b).

## Comparing species turnover in the two regions

Following calculations of $\overline{J}_{\mathrm{QDS}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{HDS}}$ for each HDS-cell in each region, we used non-parametric Mann-Whitney $U$-tests to compare the distributions of values in the Cape and SWA. The Cape possesses generally greater floristic turnover than SWA, for both measures of turnover defined here ($P < 0.0001$, Figure \@ref(fig:turnover)a,b). Being derived from Jaccard distances, $\overline{J}_{\mathrm{QDS}}$ measures the average pairwise proportional floristic turnover between QDS in each HDS<!--TODO: expand-->. $T_{HDS}$, however, represents the latter of two partitionings of $\gamma$-diversity (i.e. HDS-scale richness here): $\alpha$- and $\beta$-diversity. As $\gamma$-diversity in the Cape is more greatly a function of $\beta$-diversity than in SWA, the complement is necessarily true: $\gamma$-diversity in the Cape is less a function of $\alpha$-diversity than in SWA.

## Predicting richness and turnover with environmental heterogeneity

Vascular plant species richness and turnover are found to both be predicted primarily by environmental heterogeneity in the Cape (Figure \@ref(fig:species-environment-relationships)a--c) and at least in-part by environmental heterogeneity in SWA (Figure \@ref(fig:species-environment-relationships)d--f). Our six BRT-models performed adequately, and detected relationships between patterns of species occurrence and the environment that do not occur by chance in the permuted datasets (Figures \@ref(fig:BRT-model-quality) and \@ref(fig:species-environment-relationships), Table \@ref(tab:BRT-quality-perms)).

BRT-models of species richness at the QDS-scale in each region seemed to generally performed best, as these models had generally fit the greatest number of trees ($nt$, Figure \@ref(fig:BRT-model-quality)a), and higher $R^2$-values (Figure \@ref(fig:BRT-model-quality)b,c). Notably, SWA models of species richness and turnover at the HDS-scale out-performed Cape models, while at the QDS-scale the Cape models performed as-well or better (Figure \@ref(fig:BRT-model-quality), Table \@ref(tab:BRT-quality-regions)).

Across our BRT-models of species richness and turnover, the sets of environmental variables important to model predictions differ substantially between the Cape and SWA, both in terms of which aspects of the environment were found to be biologically relevant and in terms of the relative importance of absolute and heterogeneity variables (Figure \@ref(fig:species-environment-relationships)). Most obviously, species richness and turnover in the Cape are predicted in majority by environmental heterogeneity, which is not the case in SWA (piecharts inset Figure \@ref(fig:species-environment-relationships)). Species richness and turnover in the Cape are predicted by a broad suite of environmental variables, with no individual variable contributing more than ca. 20% to any model prediction (Figure \@ref(fig:species-environment-relationships)a--c). The SWA models' predictions, however, are largely determined by MAP (Figure \@ref(fig:species-environment-relationships)d--f).

more strongly predicted by elevational, climatic and edaphic heterogeneity (Figure \@ref(fig:species-environment-relationships)a), richness in SWA is mostly predicted by absolute MAP (Figure \@ref(fig:species-environment-relationships)b). Indeed, Cape species richness is mostly predicted by environmental heterogeneity variables (Figure \@ref(fig:species-environment-relationships)a inset), while SWA species richness is mostly predicted by absolute environmental variables (Figure \@ref(fig:species-environment-relationships)b inset).

Concerning BRT-models of vascular plant species turnover, elevational heterogeneity is the most important predictor in both the Cape and SWA (Figure \@ref(fig:species-environment-relationships)c,d). Also in both regions land surface temperature heterogeneity is an important predictor, especially in SWA (Figure \@ref(fig:species-environment-relationships)c,d). Moreover, species turnover in SWA was found to only depend on two heterogeneity variables (Figure \@ref(fig:species-environment-relationships)d).
