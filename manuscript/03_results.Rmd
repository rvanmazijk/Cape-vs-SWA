## Describing environmental heterogeneity across scales

Across all variables considered, the Cape is more environmentally heterogeneous<!--(i.e. grid-cells are more different from each of their neighbouring cells)-->in the majority of pairwise comparisons of grid-cells ($CLES > 0.50$, Mann-Whitney $U$-test: $P < 0.05$, Figure \@ref(fig:roughness)).
The Cape is thus more environmentaly heterogeneous than SWA overall, but the degree to which it is more heterogeneous varies between environmental variables.
These effects vary somewhat with the spatial scale concerned.
In some variables, the differentiation between Cape and SWA heterogeneity lessens at coarser scales (Figure \@ref(fig:roughness)).
Indeed, when comparing the overall ranking and medians of Cape vs SWA roughness values for each variable, we only find non-significant differences at the coarser 3QDS scale (Mann-Whitney $U$ tests, $P > 0.05$, Figure \@ref(fig:roughness)).

Most obviously, and as expected, topographic heterogeneity is greatest in the Cape (Figure \@ref(fig:roughness)a)<!--SWA is _flat_! [@ref]-->.
Though SWA has a slightly wider distribution of elevational roughness values at coarse scales (e.g. 3QDS, Figure \@ref(fig:roughness)a) compared to fine scales (0.05ยบ), so does the Cape.
As such, the relative difference between the two regions seems invariant with spatial scale ($CLES \approx 0.95$, Figure \@ref(fig:roughness)).

This concurs with our expectations, as the Cape is mountainous and known to have steep elevational gradients [@ref], while SWA is much more topographically uniform.

Intuitively, then, elevation serves as a "benchmark test" for our comparisons of EH here, as it is well known and expected that the Cape should be more elevationally heterogeneous than SWA.
Additionally, we can conclude that although there are greater extreme values of Cape elevational roughness at 0.05ยบ x 0.05ยบ scales, larger sections of land (i.e. 3QDS-cells) are are more different from each other in the Cape than the same sized sections are different from each other in SWA.

Climatic heterogeneity presents less differentation between the Cape and SWA than elevational roughness, though still the Cape predominates (Figure \@ref(fig:roughess)b).
Notably, the difference between Cape and SWA mean annual rainfall and land surface temperature heterogeneity lessens when considered at coarse spatial scales (3QDS scale, Figure \@ref(roughness)b).
Rainfall seasonality (PDQ), however, is similarly more heterogeneous in the Cape across all spatial scales considered.

Biological productivity, as measured by NDVI, varies spatially to a similar extent in the Cape and SWA (i.e. is more similarly heterogeneous, $CLES < 0.60$, Figure \@ref(fig:roughness)c).

Concerning edaphic variables (Figure \@ref(fig:roughness)d), the Cape and SWA are similarly heterogeneous at coarser scales, particularly in terms of CEC and Soil C.

We can differentiate the Cape and SWA environments based on which environmental axes are more heterogeneous in either region, as they differ somewhat in this regard.

## Species richness as determined by species turnover <!--TODO: reword-->

<!--Quantifying the "general" degree of species turnover in each region-->

Following quantile regressions of the 5%-quantile of pairwise species turnover against the distance between pairs' sites (Figure \@ref(fig:richness-vs-turnover)a), there is evidence that SWA exhibits a lower lowermost-bound of observed species turnover. This is because of the relative positive influence of a site's being "from the Cape", as opposed to SWA, on the 5%-quantile of species turnover ("Cape"-term, $P < 0.001$, Table \@ref(tab:turnover-vs-geodist-model-table)).
As expected, species turnover was greatest between distant pairs of QDS ($P < 0.001$, Table \@ref(tab:turnover-vs-geodist-model-table), Figure \@ref(fig:richness-vs-turnover)a).

<!--How species richness is determined by species turnover-->

<!--Logic: Richness @ coarse scale ~ $\sum$ Richness @ finer scale + $\sum$ Turnover @ finer scale-->

When plotting coarse scale richness (HDS) against fine scale richness and turnover (QDS) (Figure \@ref(fig:richness-vs-turnover)b,c), we see that for a mean QDS richness, Cape HDS are generally more species rich than SWA HDS.
Also, for a given mean QDS turnover, Cape HDS are generally more species rich than SWA HDS.
For the sake of interpretation, it is appealling to think of the graph inverted: for a given HDS richness (taken as the horizontal axis now), the Cape is less rich and has less turnover between QDS than SWA.
However, the graph was plotted as presented for the sake of agreement with the regression model (below), which does support the sentiment of an inverted interpretation.

Following the regressions of coarse scale richness (HDS) against fine scale richness and turnover (QDS) (Equation \@ref(eq:S-HDS-formula)), we see a significant negative interaction between SWA and mean QDS richness (Table \@ref(tab:species-model-table)), supporting the visually obvious difference between the Cape in SWA in Figure \@ref(fig:richness-vs-turnover)b.

<!--...--->

Assume HDS scale richness is the integration of QDS scale richness and turnover between QDS.
We can see that HDS richness "saturates" as a function of QDS richness at a lower HDS richness level in SWA than in the Cape.
Alternatively, the QDS richness required to attain a given HDS richness is much lower in the Cape---Cape QDS richness is more "powerful" and has a greater impact on HDS richness than QDS richness in SWA.
In other words: the rate of change in HDS richness ~ QDS richness in the Cape is _faster_, as is evident in the negative slope effect of the SWA on the logarithmic slope relative to the Cape.

Now for HDS richness ~ QDS turnover.
HDS richness declines with increasing turnover.
Why?
Let us turn the process on its head: why does high turnover arise from low richness QDS?
Well, when richness is low, possible opportunities for high turnover increase.<!--TODO: expand-->
The SWA interaction term for this is also negative (though only marginally significant), suggesting that the decline in observed HDS richness ~ QDS turnover is less steep in SWA.
