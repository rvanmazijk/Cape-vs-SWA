## Describing environmental heterogeneity numerically across scales

### (Consulting \ref{roughness-violins})

#### (Cape > SWA generally)

We see that---across all variables considered---Cape grid-cells are more environmentally heterogeneous (i.e. more different from each of their neighbouding cells) in the majority pairwise comparisons of grid-cells ($CLES \gt 0.50$). The degree to which Cape grid-cells are more rough is dependent on both spatial scale and the environmental variable concerned.

##### (Depends on spatial scale)

Regarding spatial scale, we see that $CLES$ of Cape vs SWA grid-cells are generally lower when grid-cells are 0.75º x 0.75º (= 3QDS), compared to 0.05º x 0.05º, though there are exceptions. Indeed, when comparing the overall ranking and medians<!--TODO: which is it?--> of Cape vs SWA roughness values for each variable with Mann-Whitney $U$ tests, we only find any non-significant (NS) differences at the coarser 3QDS scale ($P \gt 0.05$).

##### (Depends on variables concerned)

Regarding the variables concerned, we see that $CLES$ of Cape vs SWA grid-cells are generally lower ($CLES \lt 0.80$) in edaphic variables (CEC, clay, soil C, and pH) and NDVI, compared to climatic variables (MAP, PDQ, surface T) and elevation. Notably, elevational roughness at 3QDS scales is exceptionally greater in the Cape than in SWA, and indeed still much greater than in SWA at 0.05º x 0.05º scales. This speaks to the relative mountainous-ness vs flatness of the two regions. It is interesting that there is some overlap in observed elevational roughness values at the 0.05º x 0.05º scale, yet none at the 3QDS scale. This shows how although there are greater extreme values of Cape elevational roughness at 0.05º x 0.05º scales, larger sections of land (i.e. 3QDS-cells) are are more different from each other in the Cape than the same sized sections are different from each other in SWA. Furthermore, regarding elevation, the Cape is shown here to be more rough than SWA. But, we move from at fine scales having some overlap in the roughness values, which have relativly great spread in both regions, to much less overlap at coarser scales (where the spread of values is lesser). This leads us to think about: overlap and spread (below).
