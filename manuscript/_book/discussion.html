<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Discussion</h1>
<p>I have provided support for the hypothesis that the difference in plant species richness between the GCFR and SWAFR is accounted for by the fact that the GCFR is more abiotically heterogeneous than the SWAFR. As expected, the GCFR is shown to possess (i) a quantifiably more heterogeneous environment, and (ii) is heterogeneous at a finer spatial scale than the SWAFR. I have shown that vascular plant species richness (iii) can be explained in terms of environmental conditions, including environmental heterogeneity, in both the GCFR and SWAFR. Also, I have shown that (iv) the set of environmental axes that explain plant species richness, both absolute and as heterogeneity, differs between the GCFR and SWAFR. These findings contribute towards an understanding of the ecological conditions that facilitate species coexistence (and likely stimulate ecological speciation) in these two regions.</p>
<p>These two regions present differentiable environmental spaces, each with heterogeneity varying across spatial scales. The clear separation of the regions’ topographic features is as expected (Figures A, ). Indeed, topography seems to be the most striking distinction between the regions. The Cape region has been found previously to have the second highest median topographic heterogeneity of the five Mediterranean-climate regions <span class="citation">[@Bradshaw2014]</span>. The GCFR has a much wider range of scales exhibited in the heterogeneity across its environmental axes. Notably, each region has finer scale heterogeneity in some variables, and coarser scale in others—neither region is necessarily more fine or coarse than the other, as it depends on the variable concerned. BRT-models of species richness in both regions reveal species richness to depend on those environmental axes that differentiate the two regions (Figures ), ). The importance of variables is also shown to vary with spatial scale (Figure ), as previously suggested may be the case when modelling geographic patterns of biodiversity <span class="citation">[@Baudena2015]</span>. Indeed, as <span class="citation">@Cowling1996</span> describes differing patterns of species richness across spatial scales, so do the predictors of those patterns vary with scale <span class="citation">[@Hart2017]</span>.</p>
<p>The fact that a combination of absolute and roughness variables is also as predicted by the hypothesis in this study. In the models developed by <span class="citation">@Cramer2016</span> for South Africa, roughness in topography was largely superseded as an important predictor of species richness by other roughness variables. My models, however, did not show this. Similar to the study by <span class="citation">@VanRensburg2002</span>, my models revealed roughness in topography and other variables to be important. Although, <span class="citation">@VanRensburg2002</span> considered differences within pixels, as opposed to this study, which considered differences between pixels. My models, those of <span class="citation">@Cramer2016</span>, and those of <span class="citation">@VanRensburg2002</span>, do not all concur as to the role of roughness in elevation vs. more biologically meaningful variables in explaining species richness. The source of these discrepancies is unclear, though no doubt complex. The complements of environmental variables and methodologies used in these studies do differ, limiting extensive comparison between these analyses.</p>
<p>The determinants of vascular plant species are shown to be region specific (Figures , , ). The importance of MAP and roughness in rainfall seasonality (PCV) in predicting richness in the SWAFR (Figure I, J), aligns with the steep climatic gradients observed there <span class="citation">[@Cook2015]</span>. The soil variables that determine plant species richness in the model for the SWAFR (Figures K, L) differ to those that determine richness in the GCFR (Figures G, H), further highlighting the edaphic differences between these two regions. Although both are nutrient leached systems, the SWAFR is flat, with soil-chronosequences <span class="citation">[@Cook2015; @Laliberte2014]</span>, while the GCFR is mountainous <span class="citation">[@Verboom2017; @Cramer2014; @Cowling1996]</span>. The importance of roughness in soil density, and absolute texture, in the SWAFR (Figures K, L) highlights the changes in soil that are associable with age of the substrate (e.g. particle size) as being biologically relevant to species richness. The positive effect of soil clay content on species richness in the SWAFR aligns with the findings of <span class="citation">@Laliberte2014</span> that richness in the SWAFR increases with soil age.</p>
<p>NDVI is more heterogeneous across the GCFR than the SWAFR (Figures A). The fact that thermal variables tend to be more rough in the GCFR (Figure A) is likely due to possible covariance of the MODIS/Terra products with topography, as MODIS data used here describes land surface temperature. As the GCFR is topographically rugged, the roughness of NDVI may arise from this. Despite this, NDVI is an integrating variable, which captures information about productivity, light availability, and soil nutrients <span class="citation">[@Power2017]</span>. The fact that absolute NDVI contributes to predicting species richness in the GCFR, especially at finer spatial scales (Figure E) demonstrates the role of ecological productivity in facilitating the coexistence diverse species assemblages. Environmental heterogeneity, then, is integral to explaining patterns of species richness, but must be considered along with resource- and energy-availability axes. In so much as a diverse environmental space supports more species, the materials and productivity required for biota to thrive are also needed to support species <span class="citation">[@Bohn2004; @Kerr2001; @Kreft2007; @Gaston2000]</span>. As such, my findings, along with those of previous studies <span class="citation">[@Cramer2016; @VanRensburg2002; @Thuiller2006; @Kreft2007]</span>, suggest that there is ecological and evolutionary consequence to resource availability <em>and</em> environmental heterogeneity, in that they tend to be positively associated with species richness.</p>
<p>The combined BRT-model of species richness for both regions reveals soil clay content as an important predictor, at coarse spatial scales, despite this variable not being particularly important within each region separately (Figure ). Though this model does not strictly consider the regions as separate, this finding may indicate that the relationship between clay content and species richness differs between the regions. So far as clay content can be used to predict species richness, it matters more to those predictions when applied to large sections (i.e. coarse scales) of each regions.</p>
<p><span class="citation">@Kreft2007</span> modelled global terrestrial vascular plant species richness, which focussed on primarily absolute environmental values, underestimated the richness of the Cape flora. Though <span class="citation">@Kreft2007</span> did include topographic heterogeneity in their predictor set, topography is often a proxy for more biologically meaningful variables <span class="citation">[@Cramer2016]</span>. This explains why the inclusion of these variables (e.g. roughness in mean annual precipitation) yields more accurate predictions of species richness. Indeed, <span class="citation">@Thuiller2006</span> also included topographic heterogeneity. <span class="citation">@Cramer2016</span> described 68% of species richness at the QDS scale across South Africa. Regarding the GCFR, depending on whether one consults pseudo-<span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> (Table 3), the ratio of mean predicted to observed richness per grid-cell (Table 5), or the distributions of predicted vs. observed richness values per grid-cell (Figure ), I have achieved a similarly suitable level of predictive accuracy. There is, though, still unexplained species richness in light of my models. As <span class="citation">@Cramer2016</span>, <span class="citation">@VanRensburg2002</span>, <span class="citation">@Thuiller2006</span>, and <span class="citation">@Mouchet2015</span> have done, these macro-ecological models are a-historical. Evolutionary considerations of species richness in geographic space are worthwhile, especially in regions with environments stable over evolutionary time.</p>
<p>The findings here are correlative. There are, however, many proposed mechanisms to explain the correlative signals demonstrated here. My findings support the hypothesis that Mediterranean systems’ plant species richness is a function of spatial variability in environmental conditions. This can stimulate diversification, and maintain that diversity by providing a range of habitats for species co-existence. Oligtrophic soils can stimulate an increase in functional diversity, through the evolution of diverse nutrient acquisition strategies <span class="citation">[@Lambers2010; @Verboom2017]</span> (e.g. sclerophylly <span class="citation">[@Cook2015; @Cramer2014]</span>). An aspect of the environment I have neglected to consider is fire, shown to also contribute to predictions here in the GCFR <span class="citation">[@Cramer2016]</span>. <span class="citation">@Cardillo2012</span> have shown the structuring forces behind species co-occurrence patterns, and thus likely species richness,differ between species-pairs with different post-fire responses and those with similar post-fire responses.</p>
<!--Efforts were made herein to minimise differences in data-quality between the SWAFR and GCFR (e.g. the extensive use of remote-sensing derived data). Despite this, there is possible concern that floral occurence data and soils information use in this study are especially at risk of spatial bias in error. ... Should the data be too coarse in scale to capture patterns of species richness in reality,-->
<p>Though the GCFR was correctly predicted to have, on average, more species per grid-cell at HDS and 3QDS scales than the SWAFR, this was not the case for QDS grid-cells (Table 5). This demonstrates that the GCFR is indeed overall more rich in plant species than the SWAFR, but a given HDS in the SWAFR contains fewer species than a given GCFR HDS. Thus, the greater richness in the GCFR is a product of greater turnover in species at spatial scales no more coarse than the HDS. Species turnover is an interesting aspect to species richness studies, as it species turnover is implicit to species-area and co-existence-area relationships <span class="citation">[@Hart2017]</span>. One could expect patterns of endemism and species turnover to concur with patterns in environmental heterogeneity to some degree.</p>
<p>Following from the understanding that functionally diverse assemblages, which are more likely to be more species rich, are likely to arise and/or occur in areas with diverse ecological pressures <span class="citation">[@Molina-Venegas2015]</span>, one would expect, then, heterogeneous habitats such as those in Mediterranean-type biodiversity hotspots to exhibit high levels functional beta diversity along steep environmental gradients <span class="citation">[@Molina-Venegas2015]</span>. If the niches concerning these functions are phylogenetically conserved among those biota, then one would also expect high levels of species and phylogenetic beta diversity along these gradients <span class="citation">[@Molina-Venegas2015]</span>. This concurs with the notion put forward by <span class="citation">@Power2017</span>, wherein megadiverse systems such as these represent the results of “phylogenetic niche conservatism on a heterogeneous landscape”. Thus, species and phylogenetic turnover should covary with environmental heterogeneity in some way. Indeed, endemism, at certain scales, could also follow this pattern. <span class="citation">@Thuiller2006</span> demonstrated that there is phylogenetic and biome related determinants of species richness. This makes sense, in light of the difficulty of crossing biome boundaries in Mediterranean systems <span class="citation">[@Power2017]</span>. NDVI and light availability, and the heterogeneity therein, are associated with high levels of floristic turnover <span class="citation">[@Power2017]</span>. This may be indicative of ecological specialisation precluding species from crossing these boundaries, thus increasing the level of endemism within a region, while also increasing the level of turnover, and thus likely species richness, along environmental gradients. Although, this may be debated. <span class="citation">@Beard2000</span> state that the high levels of endemism in SWAFR are function of habitat specialisation to soil mosaics. Cf. <span class="citation">@Laliberte2014</span>, who say that this endemism is likely due to environmental filtering along these soil turnover sequences, as opposed to the juxtaposition of specialised species along soil gradients.</p>
<p>I have demonstrated support for the idea that environmental heterogeneity is positively associated with species richness, particularly Mediterranean systems. In the SWAFR and the GCFR, high levels of endemism and biodiversity are also likely the results of long-term landscape and climatic stability <span class="citation">[@Hopper1979]</span>. Thus, the roles of environmental variability through space, and stability through time, are the two main ways in which the environment relates to biodiversity in these regions.</p>
