# Pre-reading premises & notes

## "Angles" to the study

(Listed more-or-less from broadest to most specialised.)

- Macroecological theory/general questions:
  - What determines the species richness in an area?
  - What causes areas to differ in species completents?
- Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot questions:
  - How and why do these hotspots arise?
  - How do these hotspots differ in their function (particularly w.r.t. patterns of species occurence)?
    - $\rightarrow$ Comparing the Cape and SWA
- The importance of environmental heterogeneity (EH) in macroecological models of species richness and turnover
  - Identifying EH as possible mechanism by demonstrating its patterns of covariation with species richness and turnover
- Following on from Cramer & Verboom (2016. _J. Biogeog._)
  - The importance of studying the Cape flora

## Key findings to the study

Hypothesis         | Cape vs SWA       | $\checkmark$?
------------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------:
Degree of EH       | >                 | $\checkmark$
Scale EH           | <                 | $\checkmark$
Floristic turnover | >                 | $\checkmark$
$S \sim$ EH        | Both              | $\checkmark$
Types of EH        | Topography? Soil? | $\frac{1}{2}$

- The Cape is more environmentally heterogeneous than SWA
  - Consequently more species rich
  - Greater floristic turnover supports this.  
- Different axes of EH are biologically important in the Cape and SWA.

## Interpreting the major correlates of species richness and turnover

<!--TODO-->

## Issues and/or related topics to address

- Theoretical
  - Species-area relationships
  - Whittaker's additive model ($\gamma = \alpha + \beta$)
- Methodological
  - Species turnover indices
  - Spatial autocorrelation (not an issue b/c (1) autocorrelated predictors and (2) permutation tests)
  - Temporal range of data sources << that of the question(s)
- Application
  - Furthering generality of the importance of EH
  - Conservation importance of heterogeneous environments
  - Differing environments of different hotspots = different management/priorities
