# Pre-reading premises & notes

## "Angles" to the study

(Listed more-or-less from broadest to most specialised.)

- Macroecological theory/general questions:
  - What determines the species richness in an area?
  - What causes areas to differ in species completents?
- Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot questions:
  - How and why do these hotspots arise?
  - How do these hotspots differ in their function (particularly w.r.t. patterns of species occurence)?
    - $\rightarrow$ Comparing the Cape and SWA
- The importance of environmental heterogeneity (EH) in macroecological models of species richness and turnover
  - Identifying EH as possible mechanism by demonstrating its patterns of covariation with species richness and turnover
  - The importance of soil data (and how bad SoilGrids data is!)
- Following on from Cramer & Verboom (2016. _J. Biogeog._)
  - The importance of studying the Cape flora

## Key findings to the study

Hypothesis         | Cape vs SWA       | $\checkmark$?
------------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------:
Degree of EH       | >                 | $\checkmark$
Scale EH           | <                 | $\checkmark$
Floristic turnover | >                 | $\checkmark$
$S \sim$ EH        | Both              | $\checkmark$
Types of EH        | Topography? Soil? | $\frac{1}{2}$

- The Cape is more environmentally heterogeneous than SWA
  - Consequently more species rich
  - Greater floristic turnover supports this.  
- Different axes of EH are biologically important in the Cape and SWA.

## Interpreting the major correlates of species richness and turnover

Summary of drivers of patterns of species occurence:

- Cape $\sim$
  - Productivity (MAP, NDVI, SoilC, SurfT)
  - Soil
    - ... conditions (pH)
    - ... variety (RClay, RCEC, RpH)
  - Topography (RElev, RSurfT)
- SWA $\sim$
  - Productivity (MAP, NDVI, SoilC)
  - Climatic gradients (PDQ, RElev, RMAP)
  - CEC

## Issues and/or related topics to address

- Theoretical
  - Species-area relationships
  - Whittaker's additive model ($\gamma = \alpha + \beta$)
- Methodological
  - Species turnover indices
  - Spatial autocorrelation (not an issue b/c (1) autocorrelated predictors and (2) permutation tests)
  - Temporal range of data sources << that of the question(s)
- Application
  - Furthering generality of the importance of EH
    - Comment on soil data quality sensu GCFRSoils paper (Cramer et al. In rev. _J. Biogeog._)
  - Conservation importance of heterogeneous environments
  - Differing environments of different hotspots = different management/priorities

# Reading notes proper

## Autocorrelation

### Legendre 1993. _Ecology_

- NB paper outlining how to identify, remedying and accounting for spatial autocorrelation in data
- Notes the intuitive prevalance of of spatial structure in ecological datasets
- "Spatial heterogeneity is then _functional_ in ecosystems, and not the results of some random, noise-generating process, [...]"

## Biodiversity hotpots

### Cook et al. 2015. _New Phytol._

- NB summary of mediterranean region mechanisms and hypotheses (see my summary list below), with references for each
- Ref for SWAFR delimitation
- Found that steep climatic gradients contribute to SWAFR richness

Hypotheses for high plant diversity in mediterranean regions[^1]:

1. Diversification
  a. **Speciation b/o ecological specialisation**
  b. Low disperal rates
  c. Low extinction rates (b/of climatic stability)
  d. High speciation rates (e.g. b/o shorter generation times b/o fire)
  e. Pollinator specialisation
2. Co-existence
  a. **Spatial heterogeneity**
  b. Disturbance
  c. Low competition b/o ecological/life-history specialisation
3. Time for species accumulation
  a. Climatic stability
  b. Stable oligotrophic soils
  c. Pre-adaptation for xerophylly/sclerophylly

[^1]: Hypotheses/aspects that my study concerns are in bold

### Noroozi et al. 2018. _Sci. Reports_

"Both endemic richness and degree of endemicity were positively related to topographic complexity and elevational range."

### Zanne et al. 2018. _New Phytol._

"Nonlinear relationships between species and their environments are believed common in ecology and evolution, including during angiosperms’ rise to dominance."

## Cape & SWA studies

### Beard et al. 2000. _J. Biogeog._

"The Italian mediterranean zone also contains about this number but in a smaller area, while the much smaller Cape Floristic Region has almost twice as many native species."

"While those life forms are prominent in the Cape, that region differs in the great importance of herbaceous families and succulents, both of which are virtually absent from Western Australia."

"It is suggested that the dominant factor shaping the South-West Province flora is the extreme poverty of the area’s soils, a feature that emphasizes sclerophylly, favours habitat specialization and ensures relatively many local endemic species."

### Power et al. 2017. _J. Biogeog._

"Genus- and family-level dissimilarities between biomes were positively correlated with differences in LAI"

### Richardson et al. 2001. _Nature_

"diversification began approximately 7--8Myr ago, coincident with extensive aridification caused by changes in ocean currents. The recent origin of endemic species diversity in the Cape fora shows that large continental bursts of speciation can occur rapidly over timescales comparable to those previously associated with oceanic island radiations"

## Community assembly/ecology

### Ricklefs 1987. _Science_

- Local diversity $\sim$
  - "deterministic outcome of local processes within a biological community" in a "small, ecologically homogeneous area", e.g.:
    1. Competition
    2. Predation
    3. Disturbance (= spatial heterogeneity)
  - and regional-scale processes, e.g.:
    1. Disersal & migration
    2. Speciation & extinction

My thoughts: as local determinism and history are both important, we should not expect our BRT-models to predict richness 100%---there are necessarily elements missing from our study and that's fine! We only wish to tackle the local determinism + 1/2 aspect of history: in-situ ecological speciation and facilitation of the arrival of diverse assemblages in a region through the existance of diverse habitats there---i.e. environmental heterogeneity.
