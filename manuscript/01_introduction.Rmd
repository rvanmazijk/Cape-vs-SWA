# Introduction

Biodiversity represents the variety of species and the ecological and evolutionary processes that bring about those species [@Bohn2004; @more-refs]. Studying the distribution of biodiversity in space is a major avenue of biological research [@Kerr2001; @Kreft2007]. Regional-scale geographic patterns in species richness have long been studied, particularly in biodiversity hotspots [@Cook2015; @more-refs]. The spatial distribution of species richness can be explained in terms of the physical environment. Properties of the environment have been suggested to influence species richness in three ways: (i) resources and energy, which can determine the number of species able to co-exist in an area [@Kreft2007; @Gaston2000; @Mouchet2015]; (ii) stability through time, which enables species' persistence; and (iii) spatial heterogeneity, which can stimulate ecological speciation and possible barriers to gene flow and can facilitate greater levels of speciesâ€™ co-existence [@Thuiller2006; @Mouchet2015; @Cramer2016]. The physical environment, then, can be used to explain species richness in both a local-deterministic and historical sense [@Ricklefs1987].

The maintenance of species richness, particularly the coexistence of high numbers of species in biodiversity hotspots, is often regarded as "paradoxical" [@Hart2017], and is a central problem in ecology [@Hart2017; @Kreft2007; @Ricklefs1987]. Species richness is constrained by the ability of habitats to support a variety of species---its ecological carrying capacity [@Mateo2017]. This is exemplified in modelling approches, wherein species richness is a function of environmental predictors in a correlative framework ["macro-ecological models"; @Mateo2017]. Macroecological models of species richness implicitly assume that communities are saturated, following species-area and species-energy relationships, and at equilibrium with the environment [@Mateo2017]. <!--Whether these assumptions are valid remains debated [@refs; @SDM_aliens_ref; @SDMs_et_al_refs]. Despite this, correlative approaches are a useful tool when first researching specific questions concerning species richness and environmental conditions.-->

A solution to the "paradox" of species co-existence is environmental heterogeneity (EH): a more heterogeneous environment gives rise to a larger environmental space, and can thus facilitate co-existence between more species, generating more diverse species assemblages<!--at the scale of that heterogeneity-->. <!--EH can also stimulate ecological speciation, should the region be environmentally stable over evolutionary time-scales.-->Heterogeneity in the physical environment is known to be positively associated with species richness [@VanRensburg2002; @Hart2017], and has been demonstrated to do so across many taxa---e.g. Canadian butterflies [@Kerr2001], European vertebrates [@Mouchet2015], South African birds [@VanRensburg2002], in communities along marine continental margins [@Levin2010], French scarab beetles [@Lobo2004], and for global terrestrial plants [@Kreft2007]<!--TODO: add more references-->. The spatial scale of heterogeneity, or "grain" of the environment, is also important to consider [@Hart2017], as spatial scale in absolute environmental conditions has also been explored [@Baudena2015; @Mouchet2015; @Kerr2001]. Species co-existence and biodiversity maintenance is indeed suggested to be scale-dependent [@Hart2017].

EH is often under-represented in macro-ecological models of species richness, and has recently been found to explain up to ca. 95% of biome level species richness across South Africa [@Cramer2016]. Indeed, models that include EH yield better estimates of the richness of the Cape flora [@Cramer2016; @Thuiller2006]. Mediterranean-type terrestrial biodiversity hotspots, such as the Cape flora included in the models by @Cramer2016, present interesting study systems in which to investigate the relationship between the environment and species richness. These systems exhibit far greater species richness than predicted by their areas, productivities and latitudes [@Kreft2007; @Cowling1996]. There are five Mediterranean biodiversity hotspots on Earth: the California Floristic Province, the Mediterranean Basin, the Chilean Winter Rainfall-Valdivian Forests, the Greater Cape Floristic Region, and the Southwest Australia Floristic Region [@Cowling1996; @Hopper2004; @Cook2015]. These ecosystems have regular fire-cycles [@Cowling1996], climatic buffering, and long term stability [@Kreft2007], shrubby, sclerophyllous flora [@Hopper2004]. Together, they account for ca. 20% of global vascular plant species, yet only ca. 5% of global land surface areas [@Cowling1996]. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the high levels of plant species richness in these regions [@Cook2015]. The species accumulation hypothesis states that the stability of these regions has allowed many species to accrue. The species co-existence hypothesis states that these hotspots may facilitate greater degrees of species co-existence in smaller spatial areas, due to fine-scale heterogeneity in their environments. Indeed, EH has evolutionary implications too, stimulating ecological speciation across sharp environmental gradients.

Both the Southwest Australia Floristic Region (SWA) and the Greater Cape Floristic Region (Cape) are Mediterranean-type biodiversity hotspots, particularly in terms of plant species. Where the Cape (with an area of ca. 189,000 km^2^) is known to contain about 11,400 plant species (about 0.060 species per km^2^), SWA (area of ca. 270,000 km^2^) has about 3,700 species (0.014 species per km^2^) [@ManningandGoldblatt2012]. So, the Cape has ca. 4.3 times as many species per km^2^ as SWA. The Cape and SWA are appropriately often compared, due to the similarities between their environments (e.g. oligotrophic soils, an oceanically buffered moderate climate) and their plants' ecologies [@Hopper2004]. These two regions present unique flora out of the five Mediterranean systems, with high levels of endemism [@Cowling1996], and many obligate fire-adapted species [@Cowling1996]. Similarities withstanding, SWA is topographically and edaphically distinct from the Cape. The former is topographically rather uniform (i.e. flat)---uniquely so among the world's five Mediterranean-climate regions [@Hopper2004]). SWA possesses a mesoscale chronosequence dune system [@Cook2015; @Laliberte2014], while the Cape is mountainous, topographically heterogeneous, and therefore associated with a large degree of spatial climatic variability, with a fine-scale mosaic of geologies and soils [@Verboom2017; @Cramer2014; @Cowling1996]. <!--TODO: Mike: I think you need to a bit more specific about the origins of the soils and the geologies.
Just a sentence or so-->

Both regions have sources of edaphic heterogeneity, but at different scales. This edaphic variability may aid in explaining the species richness in these regions [@Beard2000; @Verboom2017]. EH of many forms will likely be important in macro-ecological models in both regions, as both regions have been relatively environmentally stable over evolutionary time-scales [@Hopper2004; @Lambers2010; @Wardell-Johnson1996; @Cramer2014; @Laliberte2014; @Cook2015]. For the Cape, high levels of species richness are thought to result from long term climatic stability, and fine grain variation in geology and soils [@Cramer2014]. The question thus arises whether heterogeneity is a significant contributor to SWA species richness. In the absence of topographic variability in SWA, it is proposed that the heterogeneity of that region is due to the juxtaposition of soil types [@Cook2015; @Laliberte2014], creating extreme edaphic variation.

<!--Aims & hypotheses-->

Our hypotheses concern the Cape and SWA's environments and floras. Our main hypothesis is that the Cape possesses greater abiotic heterogeneity, and at finer grain, compared to SWA, such as to explain the Cape's greater species richness per unit area, and proposed greater levels of species turnover between areas. We also conjecture that the heterogeneity that predicts species richness in SWA will be more pronounced in terms of edaphic variables. Here we attempt to assess five key predictions of this hypothesis, additionally investigating a seventh prediction to test the conjectured role of edaphic heterogeneity in SWA. Dealing with the two regions' environments, we assess (i) whether the Cape environment is more heterogeneous than that of SWA and (ii) whether the Cape environment has more pronounced heterogeneity at finer scales than that of SWA. Dealing with the distribution of species in the two regions, we assess (iii) whether the Cape exhibits greater levels of species turnover between areas. Relating each regions' environment and flora, we finally assess (iv) whether species richness and species turnover are adequately predicted by EH in both regions and whether (v) species richness and species turnover are better predicted by different forms of EH in either region (e.g. the importance of edaphic heterogeneity in SWA).

<!--Junk sentences that sound good-->

<!--As one moves across a heterogeneous landscape, we expect to find greater turnover in community composition, as different environments support different species.-->

<!--TODO: include more formal treatment of gamma ~ alpha + beta intro + analyses again? "As our effort here is towards explaining the species richness of these two floras, we also explore how species richness may covary with species turnover, such that areas of greater turnover should also be more rich, due to potential complementarity between neighbouring communities increasing total richness. Consequent to the Cape's greater heterogeneity, we expect to find quantifiably greater species turnover between areas in the Cape. This would concur with the Cape's greater species richness, as EH may not only support species rich Cape assemblages, but a diversity of complementary assemblages in the Cape."-->
